Another song, "Keep It Gangsta" featuring rapper Lil Scrappy, was also set to appear on the album, although it was never released as a promo single.

Burruss then teamed with Atlanta female rapper Rasheeda to form the duo Peach Candy, signed to D-Lo Entertainment.
Their first single, entitled "Bam," got little airplay and plans for this album were also put on hold.

Kandi also re-wrote and executive produced "Tardy for the Party" for Real Housewives of Atlanta co-star Kim Zolciak's debut album.
