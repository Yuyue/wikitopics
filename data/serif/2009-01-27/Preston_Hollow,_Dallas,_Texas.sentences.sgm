Preston Hollow is a neighborhood in north Dallas, Texas, USA.
History
Originally incorporated as a municipality in 1939 and provisioned by the Preston Road Fresh Water Supply District, the North Dallas town of Preston Hollow was named for the deep wooded area with creeks and hollows extending westward from Preston Road.
Preston Hollow originally extended from east of Preston Road, slightly north of Walnut Hill Lane, west of Midway Road and southwest of Northwest Highway.
In 1945 Preston Hollow residents voted to join with the city of Dallas and the municipality was annexed to Dallas shortly thereafter.
In 1956, the neighborhood association's covenant stated that only white residents were allowed to live in Preston Hollow.
This practice ended in 2000.
Present
The approximate two-square mile area lying north of Northwest Highway, south of Walnut Hill Lane, east of Midway Road and west of Preston Road remain the essential original boundaries of Preston Hollow, which is often now termed Old Preston Hollow.
However, the neighborhood is broadly defined by real estate professionals for marketing purposes as land to the north of Northwest Highway (Loop 12), south of Royal Lane, east of Midway Road and west of North Central Expressway (US 75), which areas are grouped into the Preston Hollow Elementary school attendance zone.
Preston Hollow is known as one of the wealthiest areas of Dallas.
It is also one of the wealthiest areas in Texas.
Within Old Preston Hollow can be found some of the most expensive homes in Texas as well as some of the state's wealthiest residents.

Preston Hollow in the news
In 2006, Preston Hollow Elementary School achieved notoriety after a lawsuit claiming the school's class-assignment policies violated the 1954 Supreme Court Brown v. Board of Education decision.
Judge Sam Lindsay ruled in November that the school's practices were not legal because they attempted to keep white students together even if minority students had to be placed in inappropriate courses; this ruling was mis-cited in at least one local paper as indicating that "all-white" classes had been created.
The defendants noted that not a single "whites-only" class existed in the school, and that placement was based on test scores; however, Latino claimants in the suit argued that their children were placed in bilingual or English as a Second Language classes even when test scores suggested they should be in a general education program.
The district's attorneys also argued that no harm had been caused to the minority students, prompting the trial judge to write, "The court is baffled that in this day and age, that [DISD relied] on what is, essentially, a 'separate but equal' argument".
The policies were criticized in the judge's ruling and in subsequent news articles as being an attempt to lessen white flight by attracting more parents from the surrounding, mostly white community to keep their children in the local public system rather than sending them to private schools.
In September 2008, Preston Hollow returned to national headlines when New York Post gossip columnist Cindy Adams wrote a column claiming that U.S. President George W. Bush and his wife Laura Bush had purchased a home in Preston Hollow.
Described as "a big house on five acres," Adams also claimed that this house would have "horse stables, lake views, mountain views, golf club views" and that Preston Hollow is "a town outside Dallas".
Dallas media pointed out the significant factual errors in the column and noted that the real estate agent cited denied both the report or that she had ever been contacted by the Post.
