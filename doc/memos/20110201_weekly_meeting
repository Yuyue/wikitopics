- have a full page of citations
    - cite IR textbook, topic modeling paper, LDA, vector space model, TDT
    - cite Wikipedia papers
- other tiny bits about citations
    - check if the page limit includes citation
    - put double curly braces around the title: NLTK, Twitter
    - remove page information from conference papers
    - abbreviate all the conference names
    - delete see and the trailing period
- replace the example figure with 2011's events.
- ask Courtney about typesetting
- make sure
- remove trailing words by rewriting a paragraph to get extra space
- spellcheck: showed->shown, sentencess->sentences

- count the percentage of country names
- draw histogram of the increase in page views
- generate sentences for different selection algorithms

General comments:
    Style:
        too many technical details more appropriate for project report:
            preprocessing steps - redirects and casing, file format.
        what is trending topics algorithms.
            equation or pseudo-code


- randomize order of Figure 1
- edit histories
- move this paragraph to where?
- change figure 2
- remove what of motivation?
- revise the correlation between spikes and the day on which events are selected
- summarize dataset and preprocess for article selection and clustering
- add equation or pseudo code for article selection
- cite papers about wsd, tdt, coref resolution, sentence fusion
- give both relative and absolute #s for clustering performance results
- why do some clustering methods fail? (Piracy and Moldova)
- show inter-annotator agreement for manual sentence selection
- say how ours is different (relatively) static set of articles instead of constant stream of newswire
- put histogram: better argument for why we should not use the current events from Wikipedia editors as gold standard
