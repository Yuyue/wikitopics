The oath of office of the President of the United States is an oath or affirmation required by the United States Constitution before the President begins the execution of the office.
The wording is specified in Article Two, Section One, Clause Eight): "I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States".
The requirement to take the oath
Article 2 of the the United States Constitution prescribes that the President must take the oath "before he enter on the Execution of his Office".
The 20th Amendment, however, states that the terms of the President and Vice President shall end at noon on the 20th day of January and the terms of their successors shall then begin.
It has been suggested  that the wording of the 20th Amendment, which makes no reference to the oath, superseded the requirement set out in article two of the Constitution, that the oath be taken before the President begins the discharge of his duties.
It has also been suggested, however, that the oath is still necessary, because the 20th Amendment only stipulated that the four year presidential term of office shall start at noon on January 20th, not that the President shall enter upon the exercise of his Office at that moment.
The start of the term does not exactly coincide with the new President entering upon the execution of his duties.
President Washington's first four-year term, for instance, began on March 4th and ended exactly four years later, but he only assumed the Presidency on April 30th, when he took the oath of office.
Vice-Presidents succeeding to the Presidency also assume office to finish a term that has long started.
So the start of the term does not coincide with "enter[ing] in the execution of the Office".
The controversy, however, is not of much relevance, since all Presidents who assumed office since the adoption of the 20th Amendment have continued to take the Oath.
It should be noted, however, that the Presidents-elect who took office after the enactment of the 20th Amendment were not treated as President by the judges officiating at the inauguration ceremonies before the actual oath taking, (e.g.
Chief Justice Warren Burger asked "Vice-President" Ford, "Governor" Carter, and "Governor" Reagan if they were prepared to take the oath; Chief Justice William Rehnquist addressed George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton as "Mr.
Vice-President" and "Governor," respectively, when asking the same question; and in like manner Chief Justice John Roberts posed the same question to Barack Obama four minutes past noon, addressing him by the title of "Senator").
At least in the cases of Presidents Clinton and Obama the oath was taken past noon, and, in the case of President Ford, he was succeeding to the Presidency (due to President Nixon's resignation) to finish a term that had already started; yet, they were not adressed as President by the Chief Justice before the oath was taken.
Suspension of the executive power
In 1916, the State Department determined that "there is no interval between the term of one President and the beginning of his successor, although there may be a slight interval when the executive power is suspended".
Therefore, a delay in taking the oath of office would not leave a hiatus in the office of the President, but the new president would not have the constitutional power to perform any executive function until the oath of office was taken.
Such finding was based on a 1821 ruling by Chief Justice John Marshall opining that it was "inevitable" the existence of a short "interval in which the executive power is suspended" because "the Constitution only provides that the President shall take the oath it prescribes 'before he enters on the execution of the office'".
Marshall then referred to the interval between the midnight of the 3rd of March, when the presidential term started, and the noon of the 4th, when the oath of office was taken, as it was the practice at that time, saying that "there has been uniformly and voluntarily an interval of twelve hours in which the executive power could not be exercised".
Marshall further notes that the law was silent on the exact time the oath should be taken, leaving it "at the discretion of the high officer", who could decide to take the oath on the first hour of his term in an emergency, or could defer the taking of the oath until the next day, or even at a later date, if more convenient (for instance if inauguration day fell on a Sunday); neither timing would be deemed improper, though it is reasonable to take the oath "as soon as it could be conveniently taken" so to shorten that time interval.
With the enactment of the 20th Amendment, the moment when one term ends and another begins was changed from the midnight of the 3rd and 4th of March to noon on January 20th, but the amendment only dealt with the beginning and end of the presidential term, not with the moment when the new President actually enters in the execution of his office.
All Presidents inaugurated after the enactment of the 20th Amendment have continued to take the oath of office before they enter in the execution of the office, but the inauguration ceremonies now coincide with the beginning of a new term, avoiding the twelve hour hiatus, since presidents usually take the oath of office at noon.
The issue of suspension of executive power, however, is still relevant when a Vice-President succeeds to the presidency, since there can be a larger hiatus between the death or resignation of one President and the swearing-in of the successor, and when there is a delay in the swearing-in of a new President on Inauguration Day.
Since the enactment of the 20th Amendment, the hiatus between the beginning of the term of a new President and his taking the oath of office has not been completely eliminated, since some Presidents, such as Bill Clinton in his first swearing-in, have taken the oath of office a few minutes past noon, due to slight delays in the inauguration ceremonies.
In 1961, because of a severe snow storm the previous night, the inauguration ran about an hour late, and John F. Kennedy didn't take the oath of office until about 1:00 PM.
Ancillary practices
The administrator of the oath
While the Constitution does not mandate that anyone administer the oath, the oath or is typically administered by the Chief Justice, but sometimes by another federal or state judge (George Washington was first sworn in by Robert Livingston, the chancellor of the State of New York in 1789, while Calvin Coolidge was first sworn in by his father, a Justice of the Peace and a Vermont notary public who lived in a home without electricity, phone, or running water, in 1923).
By convention, incoming Presidents raise their right hand and place the left on a Bible or other book while taking the oath of office.
William R. King is the only president or vice president sworn into office on foreign soil.
By special act of Congress, he was allowed to take his oath for the office of the Vice President on March 24, 1853 in Cuba, where he had gone because of his poor health.
He died 25 days later.
From 1789 through 2009, the swearing-in has been administered by 15 Chief Justices, one Associate Justice, three federal judges, two New York state judges, and one notary public.
Though anyone legally authorized to administer an oath may swear in a President, to date the only person to do so who was not a judge was John C. Coolidge, Calvin Coolidge's father, a notary whose home the then-Vice President was visiting in 1923 when he learned of the death of President Warren G. Harding.
Sarah T. Hughes is the only woman to administer the oath of office (she was a U.S. District Court judge who swore Lyndon Johnson into office on Air Force One after the Kennedy assassination).
The option of taking an oath or an affirmation
Franklin Pierce was the only president known to use the word affirm rather than swear.
Theodore Roosevelt did not use a Bible when taking the oath in 1901.
Dwight Eisenhower, Harry Truman, and Richard Nixon swore the oath on two Bibles.
John Quincy Adams swore on a book of law.
Lyndon B. Johnson was sworn in on a Roman Catholic missal on Air Force One.
Washington kissed the Bible afterwards, and subsequent presidents followed suit, up to Harry Truman,, but Dwight Eisenhower broke that tradition by saying his own prayer instead of kissing the Bible.
Barack Obama used a Bible when taking the oath the first time, but then did not use a Bible when re-taking the oath in private the following day.
Forms of administering the oath
There have been two forms of administering, and taking, the oath of office.
The first, now in disuse, is where the administrator articulates the constitutional oath in the form of a question, and modifying the wording from the first to the second person, as in, "Do you George Washington solemnly swear .."., requesting an affirmation.
At that point a response of "I do" or "I swear" completes the oath.
It is believed that this was the common procedure at least until the early 20th century.
In 1881, the New York Times article covering the swearing in of Chester A. Arthur, reported that he responded to the question of accepting the oath with the words, "I will, so help me God".
In 1929, Time magazine reported that the Chief Justice began the oath uttering, "You, Herbert Hoover, do you solemnly swear .
.
".
Hoover replied with a simple "I do".
In the second, and current form, the administrator articulates the oath in the affirmative, and in the first person, so that the President takes the oath by repeating it verbatim.
Many times the President-elect's name is added after the "I"; for example, "I, George Washington, do .
.
".
Lyndon B. Johnson did not add his name when swearing his first oath of office after Kennedy's death; there is evidence that in all other inaugurations since Franklin Roosevelt's first, the name of the president was added to the oath.
Oath flubs
In 1909, when President William Howard Taft was sworn in, Chief Justice Melville Fuller misquoted the oath, but the error was not publicized at the time.
The mistake was similar to the one Taft himself would make twenty years later when swearing in President Hoover.
Recalling the incident, Taft wrote, "When I was sworn in as President by Chief Justice Fuller, he made a similar slip," and added, "but in those days when there was no radio, it was observed only in the Senate chamber where I took the oath".
In 1929, Chief Justice William Howard Taft garbled the oath when he swore in President Herbert Hoover using the words "preserve, maintain, and defend the Constitution", instead of "preserve, protect, and defend".
The error was picked up by schoolgirl Helen Terwilliger on the radio.
Taft eventually acknowledged his error, but did not think it was important, and Hoover did not retake the oath.
In Taft's view, his departure from the text did not invalidate the oath.
In 1941, C. Elmore Cropley, the Supreme Court clerk who held the Bible for President Franklin Roosevelt's third inauguration dropped the Bible after the oath was given.
Photos detailing the mishap filled a full page of Life magazine the next week.
In 1945, President Harry S. Truman's bare initial caused an unusual slip when he first became president and took the oath.
At a meeting in the Cabinet Room, Chief Justice Harlan Stone began reading the oath by saying "I, Harry Shippe Truman, .
.
".
Truman responded: "I, Harry S. Truman, .
.
".
In 2009, Chief Justice John G. Roberts, while administering the oath to Barack Obama, incorrectly recited part of the oath after Obama spoke over him.
Roberts stated, "That I will execute the Office of President to the United States faithfully".
Obama stopped at "President," and waited until Roberts corrected "to" to "of," but then repeated Roberts' prompt, with the misplaced "faithfully".
The oath was re-administered the next day by Roberts at the White House.
Retaking the oath of office
Seven presidents have repeated their oath of office, for different reasons:
Presidents Chester A. Arthur (1881) and Calvin Coolidge (1923) took their first oath in a private venue (their residences), in the middle of the night, immediately after being notified of the death of a predecessor (James A. Garfield and Warren G. Harding, respectively).
They later retook the oath after returning to Washington.
In the case of Coolidge, there was an additional doubt whether an oath administered by a public notary (Coolidge's father) was valid.
Four presidents took a private oath when Inauguration Day fell on a Sunday, and then a second oath in a scheduled public ceremony on the next day (Monday): Rutherford B. Hayes in 1877 (who actually took the private oath on March 3rd, a Saturday, one day before his term started), Woodrow Wilson in 1917, Dwight Eisenhower in 1957, and Ronald Reagan in 1985.
On January 21, 2009 , Chief Justice Roberts administered the presidential oath a second time to Barack Obama "out of an abundance of caution," according to the White House, due to the fact that, when the oath was administered to President Obama the first time, in the public inauguration ceremony, the word "faithfully" was misplaced.
The second oath was administered in a simple, private ceremony in the Map Room of the White House.
Obama's oath-retaking differed from all his predecessors' in that the private ceremony happened after the public one.
"So help me God"
The phrase "So help me God" is explicitly prescribed in oaths as early as the Judiciary Act of 1789, for U.S. officers other than the President.
Although the phrase is mandatory in oaths, the said Act also allows for the option that the phrase to be omitted by the officer, in which case it would be called an affirmation instead of an oath.
Quote: "Which words, so help me God, shall be omitted in all cases where an affirmation is admitted instead of an oath".
In contrast, the oath of the President is the only oath specified in the Constitution, which is silent concerning the use of the closing phrase "So help me God", though also allowing for the optional use as an affirmation.
In practice, however, most Presidents have opted to take the oath (rather than an affirmation), to use a Bible to do so, and also to close the oath with the customary phrase.
It is uncertain how many Presidents used a Bible or added the words "So help me God" at the end of the oath, or in their acceptance of the oath, as neither is required by law; unlike many other federal oaths which do include the phrase "So help me God".
There is currently debate as to whether or not George Washington, the first president, added the phrase to his acceptance of the oath.
All contemporary sources fail to mention Washington as adding a religious codicil to his acceptance.
There have been two forms of administering, and taking, the oath of office.
The first, now in disuse, is where the administrator articulates the constitutional oath in the form of a question, as in, "Do you George Washington solemnly swear .."., requesting an affirmation.
At that point a response of "I do" or "I swear" completes the oath.
Without verbatim transcripts, the scant existing evidence shows this was the common procedure at least until the early 20th century.
In 1881, the New York Times article covering the swearing in of Chester A. Arthur, reported that he responded to the question of accepting the oath with the words, "I will, so help me God".
In 1929, Time magazine reported that the Chief Justice began the oath uttering, "You, Herbert Hoover, do you solemnly swear .
.
".
Hoover replied with a simple "I do".
It is the second, and current form of administration, where both the Chief Justice and the President articulate the oath, that appending "So Help Me God" is arguably a breach of the constitutional instructions.
This is the contention of a Federal law suit filed in the District of Columbia by Michael Newdow on December 30, 2008.
In this suit a distinction is made between the words spoken by the administrator, which must conform to the exact 35 words of the constitution, and the President, who has a right to add a personal prayer, such as "So Help Me God".
The earliest known source indicating Washington added "So help me God" to his acceptance, not to the oath, is attributed to Washington Irving, aged six at the time of the inauguration, and first appears 65 years after the event.
Even if Irving's report is accurate, it would not by logic, law or intent alter the actual words of the oath, being more accurately described as a personal prayer by the President after completing the oath of office.
The only contemporary account that repeats the oath in full, a report from the French consul, Comte de Moustier, states only the constitutional oath, without reference to Washington's adding "So Help Me God" to his acceptance.
Evidence is lacking to support the claim that Presidents between Washington and Abraham Lincoln used the phrase "So help me God".
A contemporaneous newspaper account of Lincoln's 1865 inauguration states that Lincoln appended the phrase "So help me God" to the oath.
This newspaper report is followed by another account, provided later in the same year after Lincoln's death (April 15, 1865), that Lincoln said "So help me God" during his oath.
The evidence pertaining to the 1865 inauguration is much stronger than that pertaining to Lincoln's 1861 use of the phrase.
Several sources claim that Lincoln said "So help me God" at his 1861 inauguration, yet these sources were not contemporaneous to the event.
Shortly after giving the speech, Lincoln stated that his oath was "registered in Heaven", something some have taken as indicating he likely uttered the phrase "So help me God".
Conversely, there was a claim made by A.M. Milligan (a radical Presbyterian minister who wanted the U.S. government to be officially Christian) that letters were sent to Abraham Lincoln asking him to swear to God during his inaugurations, and Lincoln allegedly wrote back saying that "God's name was not in the Constitution, and he could not depart from the letter of that instrument".
Other than the president of the U.S., many politicians (including Jefferson Davis, sworn in as president of the Confederate States of America in 1861) used the phrase "So help me God" when taking their oaths.
Likewise, all federal judges and executive officers were required as early as 1789 by statute to include the phrase unless they affirmed, in which case the phrase must be omitted.
Since Franklin Roosevelt, all presidents have added the phrase "So help me God".
