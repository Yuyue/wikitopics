11 After several centuries of disagreement, all churches accepted the computation of the Alexandrian Church (now the Coptic Church) that Easter is the first Sunday after the Paschal Full Moon, which is the first moon whose 14th day (the ecclesiastic "full moon") is on or after March 21 (the ecclesiastic "vernal equinox").
10 Easter falls each year on a Sunday between March 22 and April 25 inclusive (April 4 and May 8 in Eastern Christianity), following the cycle of the Moon.
124 In Western Christianity, using the Gregorian calendar, Easter always falls on a Sunday between March 22 and April 25 inclusively.
163 Accordingly, Gregorian Easter can fall on 35 possible dates - between March 22 and April 25 inclusive.
