Ricky Hatton vs. Manny Pacquiao, billed as The Battle of the East and West, was a boxing light welterweight superfight for the International Boxing Organization (IBO) and The Ring light welterweight (super lightweight) championship.
The bout was held between Manny Pacquiao of General Santos, Philippines and Ricky Hatton from Manchester, United Kingdom.
The fight was held on May 2, 2009 at the MGM Grand Las Vegas at Las Vegas, Nevada, United States.
Hatton was knocked down by Pacquiao twice during the first round, and another time in the second round to lose via 2nd round KO.
The fight received the most mainstream attention than any other Pacquiao fight, more than the De La Hoya fight.
Negotiations
With Pacquiao winning his bout against Oscar De La Hoya, Ricky Hatton was seen as the next opponent for Pacquiao.
At mid-December, both boxers verbally agreed on a 50% split of the proceeds; however, Pacquiao changed his decision to a favorable 60%–40% split of the pay-per-view (PPV) revenues, while Hatton wanted an even 50% split.
Pacquiao's promoter Bob Arum of Top Rank Boxing said on January 22 that the fight "was off," citing Pacquiao's decision not to sign the contract.
Arum increased Pacquiao's guaranteed purse to US$12 million from $11 million and a 52%–48% split.
Pacquiao's camp asked for "more demands and the deal fell apart," he said.
On January 23, with long-time friend and non-drinker Rex "Wakee" Salud "downing three bottles of beer", Pacquiao signed the contract with the 52%–48% split and a $12 million purse, in favor of Pacquiao.
Philippine TV rights
Solar Sports will produce the program for Pacquiao's fight for the Philippine market, airing it live on Solar All-Access, with the delayed telecast on GMA Network, and replays on C/S 9 and the Solar Sports TV channel.
However, rumors started going around on March 16 that Pacquiao would ditch Solar and instead "a giant network" would air the bout in the Philippines.
On March 18, Pacquiao went public, announcing that his fight with Hatton would be aired on ABS-CBN.
Pacquiao was the one who sought a deal with ABS-CBN, although details of the contract were not disclosed.
GMA and Solar assailed Pacquiao, with GMA reviewing the status of Pinoy Records, Pacquiao's TV show in GMA.
Pacquiao faxed Solar a letter saying he is rescinding his contract, which runs until 2011.
A late payment by Solar amounting to PHP60 million per fight, was seen as the one of the reasons.
However, Solar countered that "Pacquiao has no reasons (to leave) because we have settled all our (financial) obligations with him".
As a result, Solar would sue Pacquiao and ABS-CBN for P150 million, or at least secure a court injunction.
ABS-CBN countered with a stern warning saying it will fight all the way to protect its newest client’s wishes.
Solar denied claims that Pacquiao broke off from their deal because of delayed payments, adding that what they had not forwarded to the fighter were the “advance payments” he was seeking.
Pacquiao dares Solar to show financial records, including all of Pacquiao's fights aired on Solar.
At their press conference, Solar handed out copies of its License Agreement to the media who attended the press conference.
A check by ABS-CBN News revealed that the payment details were omitted from the copies distributed.
Solar executives went to Los Angeles to meet with Pacquiao to fix the issue.
However, after meeting with Solar executives, Pacquiao announced that he and Solar had "favorably resolved their unfortunate misunderstanding," Pacquiao said in a press statement.
Furthermore, Pacquiao through his lawyer said that neither party violated the contract and that it is valid and binding.
Pacquiao furthermore apologized to his fans for any confusion that may have been caused by his decision to cut and then renew his ties with Solar Entertainment; ABS-CBN said for its part "we will not stand in the way if he decides to change his mind".
Pre-fight hype
Pacquiao and Hatton toured the United Kingdom for the promotion of their fight; while in the UK, Hatton beat Pacquiao in a game of darts.
Hatton presented Pacquiao a jersey of Manchester City F.C.
after the game.
Martin Nievera was chosen to sing the Lupang Hinirang, the Philippine national anthem, for Pacquiao's battle against Hatton.
He was the first ever male singer to sing the anthem at Pacquiao's bout.
Also, WWE star Batista led Pacquiao to the ring.
Sir Tom Jones sang "God Save the Queen" while Filipino-Mexican Jasmine Villegas sang "The Star-Spangled Banner".
As support for the fight, HBO aired "Pacquiao/Hatton: 24/7" for two weeks prior to the fight on television and on the internet; it aired in the Philippines on GMA the night before the fight on May 2.
On April 22, Hatton labelled Pacquiao as a one-dimensional fighter: "Manny fights the same way all the time.
He's effective at what he does but he's not a versatile fighter".
Pacquiao's trainer Freddie Roach shot back at Hatton saying his "Hitman" tag is accurate "because on May 2, Hatton is going to get hit, man, and a lot!
" Roach also predicted that the fight wouldn't last for more than three rounds.
Pacquiao also took a break from training at the Wildcard Gym in Los Angeles to throw a ceremonial first pitch at the San Francisco Giants-San Diego Padres Major League Baseball game at the AT&T Park in San Francisco as part of the annual Filipino Heritage Night.
At the April 30 press conference, the last before the fight, Hatton admitted that he was the underdog for the fight, but insisted he could still cause an upset.
"I can understand I am the underdog but it doesn't scare me," adding that "He is the best pound for pound fighter but this is my weight division".
He continued, "This fat, beer-drinking Englishman is going to shock the world again".
Pacquiao was picked by Las Vegas bookmakers as the favorite prior to the fight.
Hatton expected more than 15,000 British fans to come and support him.
This fight was Hatton's fifth in Las Vegas in less than 2½ years, and the MGM Grand Garden Arena sold out.
Prior to the bout, it was reported that Hatton's camp was in "turmoil," with Roach's source saying that "that Hatton was miserable with Mayweather and was unhappy that Mayweather had arrived late for several workouts".
Mayweather had addressed his issues with Hatton, his co-trainer Lee Beard, but wouldn't disclose the issues.
Hatton has earlier said that he is happy with Mayweather, with whom he replaced his long-time trainer Billy Graham.
Bout
In front of a sell out crowd of 16,262, Pacquiao knocked down Hatton twice in the first round: a right hook knocked down the Briton the first time; the other knockdown occurred after a combination by Pacquiao with 45 seconds left.
On the second round, Pacquiao unleashed a left hook to knock Hatton out to end the bout 2:59 into the round.
Hatton sprawled helplessly on the canvass after Pacquiao's left hand with referee Kenny Bayless's saying that "[he] didn't have to count".
Hatton lay on the canvass for several minutes before getting up; he was eventually taken to a local hospital for a precautionary brain scan.
Pacquiao's win makes him one of only two (the other being Oscar De La Hoya) to win world championships in six different weight divisions, although the record depends on how a "world championship" is defined, with many only limiting the "legitimate championships" to those sanctioned by the WBA, WBC, WBO and/or IBF.
The defeat was the second in Hatton's career but also his second in four fights, after a defeat to Floyd Mayweather, Junior; the recent mixed performance, combined with the speed of the defeat to Pacquiao, led some to call for Hatton to retire.
Undercard
Confirmed bouts:
*James Kirkland (USA) was supposed to fight Walker in the undercard but his arrest on a weapons charge caused him to be struck off the card.
Daniel Jacobs (USA) was chosen to fight Walker instead.
