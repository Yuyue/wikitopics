In 2009, it became known that Steele's former finance chairman, Alan B. Fabian, had reported to federal prosecutors that Steele used his 2006 Senate campaign fund to pay a defunct company ("Brown Sugar Unlimited") run by his sister for "catering/web services" that were never performed.
On February 7, 2009, Steele, through a spokesman, stated that the payments to his sister "were fully disclosed and are completely proper and in full compliance with all state and federal laws".
