Coretta Scott King's funeral and controversy
In 2006, at Coretta Scott King's funeral, Dr. Lowery received a standing ovation when he remarked before four U.S. Presidents in attendance:
We know now there were no weapons of mass destruction over there.
But Coretta knew and we know that there are weapons of misdirection right down here.
Millions without health insurance.
Poverty abounds.
For war billions more but no more for the poor!
Conservative observers claimed his comments were inappropriate in a setting meant to honor the life of Mrs. King, especially considering Mr. Bush was present at the ceremony.
None of Mrs. King's family has objected to Lowery's words.
President Barack Obama's inauguration benediction
On January 20, 2009, Dr. Lowery delivered the benediction at the inauguration of Barack Obama as the 44th President of the United States of America.
He opened with lines from "Lift Every Voice and Sing," also known as "The Negro National Anthem," by James Weldon Johnson.
He concluded with the following, an interpolation of Big Bill Broonzy's "Black, Brown and White":
Lord, in the memory of all the saints who from their labors rest, and in the joy of a new beginning, we ask you to help us work for that day when black will not be asked to get in back, when brown can stick around, when yellow will be mellow, when the red man can get ahead, man; and when white will embrace what is right.
Let all those who do justice and love mercy say Amen!
Say Amen!
And Amen!
This final passage drew criticism for being "divisive", or "racialist", from some conservative commentators.
Reporters in attendance called the passage a mocking of racial sterotypes, and said that the crowd received it with good humour.
