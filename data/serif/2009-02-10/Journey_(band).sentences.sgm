Journey is an American rock band formed in San Francisco, California in 1973.
The band has gone through several phases since its inception by former members of Santana.
The band's greatest commercial success came in the late 1970s through the early 1980s with a series of power ballads and songs such as "Don't Stop Believing", "Any Way You Want It", "Faithfully", "Open Arms", "Send Her My Love" "Separate Ways", "Wheel in the Sky", "Who's Crying Now", "Lights", and "When You Love a Woman".
Throughout Journey's three decades of existence they have scored two gold, three platinum, and eight multiplatinum albums, including seven straight multiplatinum albums from 1978-1987.
They have had 18 top 40 singles, six of which have reached the top ten on Billboard Hot 100 chart, and their signature song "Don't Stop Believing" is the top selling catalog track in iTunes history, reaching the 2 million mark.
According to the Recording Industry Association of America they have sold 47 million albums in the United States alone, making them the 28th best selling band.
Their worldwide sales are nearly 80 million albums.
In a 2005 poll by USA Today, Journey was voted the 5th best American rock band in history.
Journey has been eligible for induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame since 2000, but Gregg Rolie is the only current or former member of Journey who has been inducted — as a member of parent band Santana.
In 2009, Steve Perry, the band's best-known lead vocalist, will be eligible for induction as a solo artist.
History
Formation, 1973–1976
The original members of Journey came together in San Francisco in 1973 under the auspices of former Santana manager Herbie Herbert.
Originally called the Golden Gate Rhythm Section and intended to serve as a backup group for established Bay Area artists, the band included recent Santana alumni Neal Schon on lead guitar and Gregg Rolie on keyboards and lead vocals.
Bassist Ross Valory and rhythm guitarist George Tickner, both of Frumious Bandersnatch, and drummer Prairie Prince of The Tubes rounded out the group.
The band quickly abandoned the original "backup group" concept and developed a distinctive  jazz-fusion style.
After an unsuccessful radio contest to name the group, roadie John Villaneuva suggested the name "Journey".
The band's first public appearance came at the Winterland Ballroom on New Year’s Eve, 1973.
Prairie Prince rejoined The Tubes shortly thereafter, and the band hired British drummer Aynsley Dunbar, who had recently worked with John Lennon and Frank Zappa.
On February 5, 1974, the new line-up made their debut at the Great American Music Hall and secured a recording contract with Columbia Records.
They are the gayest band.
Please refrain from listening, Mustaches are for men, rabbits also.
Journey released their eponymous first album in 1975, and rhythm guitarist Tickner left the band before they cut their second album, Look into the Future (1976).
Neither album achieved significant sales, so Schon, Valory, and Dunbar took singing lessons in an attempt to add vocal harmonies to Rolie's lead.
The following year's Next contained shorter tracks with more vocals and featured Schon as lead singer on several of the songs.
New musical direction, 1977–1980
Journey's album sales did not improve and Columbia Records requested that they change their musical style and add a frontman, with whom keyboardist Gregg Rolie could share lead vocal duties.
The band hired Robert Fleischman and transitioned to a more popular style, akin to that of Foreigner and Boston.
Journey went on tour with Fleischman in 1977 and together the new incarnation of the band wrote the hit "Wheel in the Sky".
But fans were lukewarm to the change, and personality differences resulted in Fleischman being fired within the year.
In the fall of 1977, Journey hired Steve Perry as their new lead singer.
Perry added a clean, tenor sound and the band became a true pop act.
Their fourth album, Infinity (1978), reached No.
21 on the album charts and gave the band their first RIAA-certified platinum album plus hit singles out of "Lights" and "Wheel In the Sky"".
Drummer Aynsley Dunbar did not get along with singer Steve Perry and did not approve of the new musical direction.
He was fired in 1978 and replaced by Berklee-trained jazz drummer Steve Smith.
Perry, Schon, Rolie, Smith, and bass player Ross Valory recorded 1979's Evolution, which gave the band their first Billboard Hot 100 Top 20 single, "Lovin,' Touchin,' Squeezin;'" and 1980's Departure, which reached No.
8 on the album charts and included the top-25 hit "Any Way You Want It".
Journey's new-found success brought the band an almost entirely new fan base.
During the 1980 Departure world tour, the band recorded a live album, Captured.
They also recorded the soundtrack to the film Dream After Dream while in Japan.
Exhausted from extensive touring, keyboardist Gregg Rolie now left a successful band for the second time in his career.
Keyboardist Stevie "Keys" Roseman was brought in to record the lone studio track for Captured, "The Party's Over (Hopelessly in Love)," but Rolie recommended pianist Jonathan Cain of The Babys as the permanent replacement.
With Cain's replacement of Rolie's Hammond B-3 organ with his own synthesizers, the band was poised to redefine rock music for a new decade in which they would achieve their greatest musical success.
Height of popularity, 1981–1983
Journey released their eighth
==  and biggest-selling studio album, Escape, in 1981.
The album, which has thus far sold nine times platinum, went to number one on the album charts that year, and included three top-ten hits: "Who's Crying Now," "Don't Stop Believing," and "Open Arms".
Capitalizing on their success, the band recorded radio commercials for Budweiser and sold rights to their likenesses and music for use in two video games: the Journey arcade game by Bally/Midway and Journey Escape by Data Age for the Atari 2600.
MTV even wanted to participate in Journey's ever growing success by videotaping one of their two sold out shows at the Houston Summit arena in Houston, Texas.
The concert was videotaped during the Escape tour on Friday November 6, 1981 in front of over 20,000 devoted fans.
Journey's next album, 1983's Frontiers, continued their commercial success, reaching No.
2 on the album charts, selling nearly six million copies.
Four hit singles included "Separate Ways," which reached #8, and "Faithfully," which reached #12.
By this time Journey had become one of the top touring and recording bands in the world.
During the subsequent stadium tour, the band contracted with NFL Films to record a video documentary of their life on the road, Frontiers and Beyond.
Scenes from the documentary were shot at JFK Stadium in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania with more than 80,000 fans in attendance.

Break-up, 1984–1994
After the widely successful Frontiers stadium tour, Journey decided to take some time off.
Lead singer Steve Perry and guitarist Neal Schon both pursued solo projects between 1982 and 1985.
In 1985 the band released two songs previously intended for Frontiers--Only the Young, on the soundtrack to the movie Vision Quest; and Ask the Lonely, on the soundtrack to the movie Two of a Kind.
"Only the Young" managed to nick the top ten, reaching #9 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.
When Journey finally returned to record their 1986 album Raised on Radio, bass player Ross Valory and drummer Steve Smith were fired from the band for musical and professional differences.
Studio musicians handled the two vacant slots, including future American Idol judge Randy Jackson and established session player Larrie Londin.
The album went multiplatinum selling over two million copies.
It also produced  four top 20 singles, "Be Good to Yourself" #9, "Ill be Alright without you" #14, "Girl Can't Help It" #17, and "Suzanne" also reaching #17.
A truncated tour followed, which featured Jackson on bass and Mike Baird on drums.
The tour was videotaped by MTV and made into a documentary, which included interviews with the current band members and concert footage of the Mountain Aire Festival show in Angels Camp, California.
Steve Perry left Journey in 1987.
Neal Schon and Jonathan Cain teamed up with Cain's ex-Babys bandmates John Waite and Ricky Phillips, forming Bad English with drummer Deen Castronovo in 1988.
Steve Smith started a jazz band, Vital Information, and teamed up with Ross Valory and Gregg Rolie to create The Storm with singer Kevin Chalfant and guitarist Josh Ramos.
In 1988 Columbia records released Journey's greatest hits package, which remains the band's best-selling album--and according to the RIAA, has sold 15 million copies in United States to date.
It continues to sell 500,000 to 1 million copies per year, and as of December 2008, it was the 6th best selling greatest hits package in the United States.
Reunion, 1995–1997
Between 1987 and 1995, Journey's record label released three compilations.
In October 1993, Kevin Chalfant (of The Storm) performed with Neal Schon and Jonathan Cain at a roast for manager Herbie Herbert.
After that, Schon, Cain, Valory, Smith and Rolie briefly considered reuniting the band with Chalfant as lead singer.
But in 1995 Steve Perry agreed to rejoin the band on the condition that they seek new management.
Herbie Herbert was fired and The Eagles Manager Irving Azoff retained.
In 1995, Perry, Schon, Cain, Valory, and Smith reunited to record Trial by Fire.
Released in 1996, the album included the hit single "When You Love a Woman," which reached #12 on the Billboard charts and was nominated in 1997 for a Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal.
The album also produced two top 40 mainstream rock tracks, "Message of Love" reaching #18 and "Can't Tame the Lion" reaching #33, and one top 40 adult contemporary hit-"If He Should Break Your Heart" at #23.
Plans for a subsequent tour ended when Perry injured his hip hiking in Hawaii in the summer of 1997 and could not perform without hip replacement surgery — which he refused to undergo.
In 1998, Schon and Cain decided to seek a new lead singer, at which point drummer Steve Smith left the band as well.
Lead singer replaced, 1998–2006
In 1998, Journey hired drummer Deen Castronovo, Schon's and Cain's Bad English bandmate, and drummer for Hardline, to replace Steve Smith.
The lead vocalist position was filled by Steve Augeri, formerly of Tyketto and Tall Stories.
That same year, Journey with Steve Augeri and Deen Castronovo recorded a track for the soundtrack to the movie Armageddon called "Remember Me".
The band released their next studio album, Arrival, in Japan in late 2000 and in the United States in 2001.
"All the Way" became a minor adult contemporary hit from the album.
In 2002, the band released a four-track CD titled "Red 13," with an album cover design chosen through a fan contest.
In 2005 the band was inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and Steve Perry surprised many attendees by showing up for the event.
Also in 2005, Journey embarked on their 30th anniversary tour, and released their twelfth full-length studio album, Generations, in which each band member performed lead vocals on at least one song.
Lead singer replaced again, 2006–present
In July 2006, Steve Augeri was dropped from the band while they toured with Def Leppard, with the official statement citing a "chronic throat infection" as the problem.
Augeri had been suffering from vocal attrition problems since 2003 and Journey had been using pre-recorded lead vocals.
The band hired singer Jeff Scott Soto from Talisman to fill in, and Soto officially replaced Augeri as Journey's lead singer in December 2006.
On June 12, 2007, Journey announced that Soto was no longer the lead singer, and said that they were looking to move in a new direction.
In December 2007, Journey hired Filipino singer Arnel Pineda of the cover band The Zoo after Neal Schon saw him on YouTube singing covers of Journey songs.
Journey debuted their new lead singer in February 2008 in Chile, and released the album Revelation that June.
Revelation debuted at #5 on the Billboard charts, selling more than 196,000 units in its first two weeks and staying in the top 20 for 6 weeks.
Receipts from that summer's tour, featuring Heart and Cheap Trick, made Journey the eighth top grossing concert of the year, bringing in over $745,000.
And on December 18, 2008, Revelation was certified platinum by RIAA.
Although Pineda was not the first foreign national to become a member of Journey (former drummer Aynsley Dunbar is British) nor even the first non-white (former bass player Randy Jackson is African-American), the transition was difficult for a number of fans who expressed what Marin Independent Journal writer Paul Liberatore called "an undercurrent of racism".
Keyboardist Jonathan Cain responded to such sentiments: "We've become a world band.
We're international now.
We're not about one color".
Legacy and Influences
Journey continues to be one of the most successful American rock bands of all time.
They not only contributed to the success of MTV during its first few months of existence, but also helped to shape American pop music during the 1980s.
Often credited as being one of the first bands to invent the "power ballad", they made it acceptable for male rock singers to sing slow love songs.
With ballads such as "Open Arms," "Faithfully," "Who’s Crying Now," "When You Love a Woman," and "Lights," they help to form the softer side of rock music.
Their musical style is unique, using mostly pianos and synthesizers in most songs, along with the identifiable sounds of the air drum, and frequent electric guitar licks.
Many of the songs include a guitar solo at the end, highlighting the dose of harder edged rock, mixed with the strong vocals of slower love songs.
Journey was one of the first bands to host coast-to-coast stadium tours which attracted more than 60,000 fans.
The production value of the stadium tours raised the stakes for rock concerts.
With giant painted scrims covering the speakers and 60-foot video screens on each side of the stage, people could see the band as far as a quarter mile away.
Their state-of-the-art computerized lighting system set a new standard for rock concert production.
Even other music artists took notice of the elaborate stage designs.
The band's production company, Nocturne, rented identical systems to such acts as Simon and Garfunkel, David Bowie, and The Police.
Artists that have cited Journey as an influence include Chris Daughtry, The Outfield, Nickelback, Creed, Matchbox Twenty, Tall Stories, Garth Brooks, Bon Jovi, Josh Groban, and Shania Twain.
