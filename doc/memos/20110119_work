Probably I will do something more than the work already done:

	* Better clustering using LDA.
	* Better sentence selection taking the edit history into consideration.

Read more related work:

	* Read snippet selection paper by lapata and the papers citing the snippet selection paper.
	* Read the previous work using Wikipedia.

So what I want to do today is:
	* finish the sentence selection seciton, related work section, and the conclusion section.
	* make a list of the papers I want to read that are about snippet selection and Wikipedia.
	* Run LDA model.
	* Run K-means with tf-idf term weights and with a limit on the dimensionality with a variety of distance metric such as cosine, etc.
	
Some questions I have got are:
	* Both K-means and LDA need K for the number of clusters that they cluster articlces into. Clustering the tagged web paper set K as the number of different categories of web page directory. Drawing a curve with different values of K will be appropriate for a scientific paper.

Around 1:30. Chris and I agreed that running LDA is one of the most simple and basic thing to do. Chris wanted me to stop working on mini-scale (at least for a while) and start working on AAAI.

Around 5:00. The list of papers related to snippet selection:

Around 6:00. I asked Chris what is Lapata's paper about snippet selection. Luckily, it turned out to be one of the papers I read before.
