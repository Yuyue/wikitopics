The 2009 World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) Draft was the seventh Draft produced by the American professional wrestling promotion WWE.
The Draft took place on two days: the first portion was televised live for three hours on WWE's television program Raw, which aired on the USA Network in the United States, and the second portion took place via the Internet on WWE's official website, which was called the "Supplemental Draft".
The televised portion was held on April 13 in Atlanta, Georgia from Philips Arena.
The final half took place on April 15.
The 2009 WWE Draft marked the third time that it would consist of the Raw, SmackDown, and ECW brands, in which wrestlers, general managers and commentators were eligible to be drafted from the company's roster.
For the televised half, matches determined which brand received a random draft selection.
During the Supplemental Draft, brand and employee selections were made at random.
Due to Draft regulations, drafted champions took their titles to their new brands, and tag teams were not exempt from being selected.
As a result, the Draft impacted championships, and split various tag teams.
Overall, 36 draft selections were made.
Twelve were made on television: Raw (five), SmackDown (four), and ECW (one).
Twenty-four were made during the Supplemental Draft: SmackDown (10), Raw (nine), ECW (five).
All the draftees were wrestlers: 28 males (10 drafted on television) and 8 females (two drafted on television).
Raw obtained the first overall pick in the Draft, which resulted in the acquisition of United States Champion Montel Vontavious Porter from SmackDown.
Women's Champion Melina from Raw was SmackDown's first selection.
ECW's sole televised draft pick was Vladimir Kozlov from SmackDown.
Also during the Draft, SmackDown's WWE Champion Triple H was drafted to Raw; this resulted in the loss of SmackDown's prime championship.
Eventually, Intercontinental Champion Rey Mysterio from Raw was drafted to SmackDown, which replaced the loss of the United States Champion, and SmackDown's Divas Champion Maryse was drafted to Raw, which replaced the loss of the Women's Champion; these were the final draft picks during the televised portion.
Mr. Kennedy, who was sidelined with a legitimate injury, was drafted from SmackDown to Raw as the first (13th overall) supplemental pick.
SmackDown obtained Shad Gaspard from Raw as their first (14th overall) supplemental selection.
Ezekiel Jackson was ECW's first supplemental pick.
During this portion of the Draft, WWE and World Tag Team Champions The Colons (Carlito and Primo) were drafted from SmackDown to Raw; this left SmackDown without a tag team championship.
Brie Bella (from SmackDown to Raw), Charlie Haas (from Raw to SmackDown), and Hurricane Helms (from SmackDown to ECW) were the final supplemental picks.
Background
The Brand Extension storyline was initiated in March 2002, in which WWE's Raw and SmackDown!

It was also announced that a supplemental draft would be held on April 15.
