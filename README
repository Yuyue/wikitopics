Wednesday, December 1st, 2010. Rearrange the data directory structure. Made a directory called data and put all the wikistats file into the wikistats directory under data (data/wikistats). The data moved include Amazon Public Wikipedia Traffic Statistics Dataset, the files received from Shutz, and the files downloaded from Mituzas's archive. Details are explained in data/wikistats/README.

Accidentally deleted the README file from Amazon public dataset. The text file included the format of the dataset, and the original announcement by Tomas Mituzas. Probably the file is available for retrieving at AWS.
