ACL Planning

Timeline
------------------------------------------------------
Week 13  Dec 17 submission
Week 11  Dec 3  draft of paper complete (7-10 pages)

Working title:
What's popular on wikipedia and why.
Wikipedia: What's up, hon/yo/world?

* Introduction (0.5-1 page)
* System overview describing each module, and including a diagram of how they connect (1.5 pages)
 - include description of hour-by-hour wikipedia page view stats
   + show example graphs that highlight trnding topics
     - 
* Related work (.75-1 page)
 - description of Trending Topics baseline
 - lots of citations to related work
   + NewsBlaster: McKeown + Barzilay
   + Snippet Selection: + Lapata
   + A list of *ACL/EMNLP* papers that study wikipedia - AAAI + SIGIR + CHI + CIKM + *WWW*
* Experimental design
 0) Selection of articles for a given day (TT)
    <- How well does the TT algo capture wikipedia current events
       WP current events seem to be non-interesting events.
       -> This could be part of the motivation
 1) Clustering
    - gold standard clusters
      describe how created, give examples (touch on the running example), measure inter annotator agreement
    - evaluation metric citation to Amigo paper
    - baseline
 2) textual description of events
    - of a cluster or of one article in the cluster
    - simplified to selecting 1 sentence
    - complex: selecting multiple
    - future work sentence fusion
    - Baselines/contrastive selction methods

    Clustering
    ---------------------------------------------
    - choose centroid doc, then do ->
    - concat into one pseudo doc then ->
    - sentence with most links to other articles in the cluster
    - consider pages that are one link away from all articles in the cluster
    - Turker synthesized sentence for cluster

    Articles
    ---------------------------------------------
    - sentence w/ most recent temporal expression
    - choose most recently added sentence
      alt: choose from diff of current version v. 1 week ago
      tie breakers:
          date
          name/article title

 3) Evaluation
    * manually select sentences that best describe why the article or cluster was interesting on this date
      <- important to measure inter annotator agreement
    * accuracy of automatic selection, MRR (mean reciprocal rank)

* Future work
 - what NLP challenges remain
   (what BG's thesis will be about)
 - relate to Twitter stuff
 - news outside of wikipedia
 - relate to Google news

Next to do items
-------------------------------------------
1) Download raw text of the 100 articles on the 5 days.
2) Split them into sentences
3) Tag sentences with temporal expressions
  Look for regex package for dates
4) All of us:
  - for random selection of 10 articles, pick sentence that best describes why it is popular on the date or say no such sentence
5) All of us: write a sentence or short paragraph saying why the article/cluster is popular
