Professor Charles Kuen Kao CBE FRS FREng (  (Kao Kuen);  born 4 November 1933) is  a pioneer in the development and use of fiber optics in telecommunications.
Kao, widely regarded as the "Father of Fiber Optic Communications", was awarded half of the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics for "groundbreaking achievements concerning the transmission of light in fibers for optical communication".
Biography
Kao was born in Shanghai in 1933, but his ancestral home was in Jinshan, Jiangsu now part of Shanghai.
He studied Chinese classics at home with his brother, under a tutor.
He also studied English and French at an international school in Shanghai which was founded by a number of progressive Chinese educators including Cài Yuánpéi (蔡元培).
Kao's family moved first to Taiwan in 1948,  then to Hong Kong where he completed his secondary education (advanced level) at St. Joseph's College in 1952.
He did his undergraduate studies in electrical engineering at Woolwich Polytechnic (now the University of Greenwich), obtaining his Bachelor of Science degree issued by the University of London.
He then pursued research at Imperial College (at that time a college of the University of London) and received his PhD degree in electrical engineering in 1965.
While studying for his PhD degree, Kao also worked as an engineer for Standard Telephones and Cables (STC, now Nortel Networks) at their Standard Telecommunications Laboratories (STL) research centre in Harlow, England.
Kao did his groundbreaking work at STL where he was an engineer and researcher.
Kao joined the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) in 1970, to found the electrical engineering department.
Under his leadership, the School of Education and other new research institutes were established.
He then went back to ITT Corporation (the parent corporation of STC in 1974), and the United States, and worked in Roanoke, Virginia, first as chief scientist and later as director of engineering.
In 1982, he became the first ITT executive scientist and was stationed mainly at the Advanced Technology Center in Connecticut.
While there, he served as an adjunct professor and fellow of Trumbull College at Yale University.
He was Vice-Chancellor (equivalent to President in universities of the United States) of the Chinese University of Hong Kong from 1987 to 1996..
Kao then worked as the CEO of Transtech.
He is currently Chairman and CEO of ITX Services.
As of 2009, he resides in Hong Kong and often travels to the United States to visit his family.
Kao is the founder of Independent School Foundation Academy (ISF), which is located in Cyberport.
On October 6, 2009, Kao was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his contributions to the study of the transmission of light in optical fibers and for fiber communication .
Ancestry and family
Kao's father Kao Chun-Hsiang (高君湘) was a lawyer, who obtained his J.D.
from the University of Michigan Law School in 1925 .
He was a professor at Soochow University (then in Shanghai) Comparative Law School of China.
His grandfather was Kao Choi-Wan (Gao Chuiwan, 高吹萬), a famous poet, revolutionary, literator, and a key figure of Nan Society (South Society, 南社) during the late Qing Dynasty.
His father's cousin was astronomer Ping-Tse Kao (高平子, Kao Crater is named after him).
Kao has a younger brother named Kao Woo (高鋙), who is a physicist and professor of hydrodynamics.
Kao met his future wife M.Y.Huang (黄美芸) in London, when he first arrived in Britain to study.
She is British Chinese.
The two married in 1959 in Hong Kong.
The couple have two children, a son and a daughter,  both of whom reside and work in Silicon Valley, California.
Kao has been slightly suffering from Alzheimer's disease since early 2009, but has no problem in recognizing people or addresses.
Kao's father also suffered from the same disease, Kao and his wife would like to donate part of the prize money to aging research and care, possibly to Hong Kong St. James' Settlement Health Care Centre for Old People and USA Alzheimer's Association.
Pottery making, a traditional Chinese handwork, is Kao's hobby, Kao also enjoys reading Wuxia novels.
Works and related history
In early 1960s in STL, along with George Hockham, Kao did his pioneering work in the realisation of fiber optics as a telecommunications medium, by demonstrating that the high-loss of existing fiber optics arose from impurities in the glass, rather than from an underlying problem with the technology itself.
Kao did not only consider the optical physics but also the material properties.
The results were first presented by Kao in early 1966 and further published in June.
This study first theorized and proposed to use glass fibers to implement optical communication, the ideas (especially structural features and materials) described largely are the basis of today's optical fiber communication.
In 1965, Kao concluded that the fundamental limitation for glass light attenuation is below 20 dB/km (Decibels per Kilometer, is a measure of the attenuation of a signal over a distance), which is a key threshold value for optical communications.
However, at the time of this determination, optical fibers commonly exhibited light loss as high as 1,000 db/km and even more.
This conclusion opened the intense race to find low-loss materials and suitable fibers for reaching such criteria.
Kao, together with his new team (members including T.W.
Davies, M.W.
Jones, and C.R.
Wright), pursued this goal by testing various materials.
They precisely measured the attenuation of light with different wavelengths in glasses and other materials.
During this period, Kao pointed out that the high purity of fused silica (SiO2) made it an ideal candidate for optical communication.
Kao also stated that the impurity of glass material is the main cause for the dramatic decay of light transmission inside glass fiber, rather than fundamental physical effects such as scattering as many physicists thought at that time, and such impurity could be removed.
This immediately stimulated a worldwide study and production of high-purity glass fibers.
Theatrically, when Kao first proposed that such glass fiber could be used for long-distance information transfer, his ideas were widely disbelieved; later people realized that Kao's ideas revolutionized the whole communication technology and industry.
Kao also played a key role in the engineering and commercial realisation of optical communication.
Kao visited many research institutes including Bell Laboratories and even glass factories, discussed with various people including engineers, scientists, businessmen about the techniques and improvement of glass fiber manufacture.
