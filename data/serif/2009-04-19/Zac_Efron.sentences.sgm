Zachary David Alexander "Zac" Efron (born October 18, 1987) is an American actor and singer.
He began acting professionally in the early 2000s, and became known to young audiences after his roles in the Disney Channel Original Movie  High School Musical, the WB series Summerland, and the 2007 film version of the Broadway musical Hairspray.
Speaking to Newsweek in June 2006, director Adam Shankman described Efron as "arguably the biggest teen star in America right now".
In 2007, right before the release of High School Musical 2, Rolling Stone declared him the "poster boy for tweenyboppers" and featured him in their late August issue.
Early life and background
Efron was born in San Luis Obispo, California and later moved to Arroyo Grande, California.
His father, David Efron, is an engineer at a power plant, and his mother, Starla Baskett, is a former secretary who worked at the same power plant as Efron's father.
Efron had a self-described "normal childhood" in a middle class family, and has a younger brother, Dylan.
Efron is of Jewish ancestry and is an agnostic, having never been religious.
He has said that he would "flip out" if he got a B and not an A in school, and that he was a "class clown".
Although self-described as not academically gifted, he remained focused enough to achieve an  overall GPA of 4.3.
Efron's father encouraged him to begin acting when Efron was eleven.
He subsequently appeared in theater productions at his high school, worked in a theater called The Great American Melodrama and Vaudeville, and began taking singing lessons.
Efron performed in plays such as Gypsy, Peter Pan, Or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up, Little Shop of Horrors, and The Music Man.
Efron was recommended to an agent in Los Angeles by his drama teacher, Robyn Metchik (the mother of actors Aaron Michael Metchik and Asher Metchik).
He was later signed to the Creative Artists Agency.
Education
Efron graduated from Arroyo Grande High School in 2006, and was then accepted into the University of Southern California, but he deferred his enrollment while he worked on film projects.
He plans to return at some time.
Efron also attended Pacific Conservatory of the Performing Arts, a community college located in Santa Maria, California, which provided him with the opportunity to perform as a "young player" during the years of 2000 and 2001.
Acting career
In 2002, Efron began to appear in guest roles on several television series, including Firefly, ER, and The Guardian.
He portrayed Cameron Bale on the now-cancelled WB series Summerland.
Originally introduced as a recurring character, Efron became a regular cast member on the show in the second season in 2004, starring opposite the likes of Kay Panabaker, Lori Loughlin and Jesse McCartney.
Since appearing in Summerland, he has also had guest roles on the shows CSI: Miami, NCIS (TV series),  The Suite Life of Zack & Cody and The Replacements.
In 2003, Efron starred in the Lifetime original television movie Miracle Run.
He played Steven Morgan, one of two autistic twins.
For his performance, he was nominated for a Young Artist Award for Best Performance in a TV Movie, Mini-series or Special — Supporting Young Actor.
In 2005, he played a main character in Hope Partlow's music video for her song "Sick Inside".
Also in 2005, he played horse-loving Patrick McCardle in The Derby Stallion, where his character wants to beat the town bully at the steeple chase race.
2006: High School Musical
In 2006, Efron starred in the Disney Channel original movie High School Musical as Troy Bolton, the popular student and captain of the basketball team.
The film, which he initially made with "low expectations", helped Efron gain recognition among teenage audiences as both an actor and a singer.
As a result, he placed as high as #4 on the IMDBPro's STARMeter for the week of January 29, 2006.
In August 2006, Efron won a Teen Choice Award in the Breakout Star and the TV — Choice Chemistry categories, shared with Vanessa Hudgens.
The film's cast, along with Efron, toured Sydney, Australia, London, England, and other locations to promote the film.
Shortly after High School Musical aired, Efron debuted with two simultaneous charted songs on Billboard Hot 100 on February 4, 2006, with "Get'cha Head in the Game" and "Breaking Free", a duet with Vanessa Hudgens from the film.
On the following week's chart, Efron had five simultaneous song credits from High School Musical: "Get'cha Head in the Game", "Start of Something New", "What I've Been Looking For: Reprise", "We're All in This Together" and "Breaking Free".
"We're All in This Together" was credited to the whole High School Musical cast.
"Breaking Free", at the time, made the fastest climb in the history of the Billboard charts, from #86 to #4 between the two weeks; the record was beaten by Beyoncé and Shakira's "Beautiful Liar".
Efron also appeared in the 2006 Disney Channel Games as captain of the Red Team.
Efron's singing talents were disputed when it was revealed that Andrew Seeley's voice was blended with his on the soundtrack of High School Musical.
An August 23, 2007 interview in Rolling Stone magazine revealed that he had been cast in High School Musical after the songs were written, and the songs (written for a tenor) were somewhat out of his baritone vocal range.
However, Efron stated in interviews that he felt his future is that of a serious dramatic actor, not necessarily a singer.
