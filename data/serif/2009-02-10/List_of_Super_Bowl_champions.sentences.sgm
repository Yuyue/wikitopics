<onlyinclude>The Super Bowl is an annual American football game that determines the champion of the National Football League (NFL).
The contest is held in an American city that is chosen years in advance, usually in warm-weather or domed sites.
The winner of the AFC Championship Game faces the winner of the NFC Championship Game in the culmination of the NFL playoffs.
Before the 1970 merger between the American Football League (AFL) and the National Football League (NFL), the two leagues met in a World Championship Game.
Currently the NFC leads in Super Bowl wins with 22, while the AFC has won 21.
The NFL and AFL each won two World Championships.</onlyinclude>
Five active NFL teams have yet to appear in a Super Bowl: the Cleveland Browns, Detroit Lions, Houston Texans (2002 expansion team), Jacksonville Jaguars (1995 expansion team), and New Orleans Saints.
The Kansas City Chiefs and New York Jets have not appeared in the Super Bowl since the merger in 1970.
