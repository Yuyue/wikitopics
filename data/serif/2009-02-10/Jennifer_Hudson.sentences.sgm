IM NOT TRY
Jennifer Kate Hudson (born September 12, 1981) is an  American singer and actress.
She first gained notice as one of the finalists on the third season of the FOX television series American Idol.
She went on to star in the 2006 motion picture Dreamgirls for which she has won numerous awards, including an Academy Award, a Golden Globe Award, a BAFTA, and a SAG Award.
Her solo singing career added to her film success and she recently scored three Grammy Award nominations, winning one for Best R&B Album.
Early life
Hudson was born in Chicago, Illinois, the daughter of Darnell Hudson (died 2008) and Samuel Simpson (died 1999), who was a bus driver.
She was raised Baptist and attended Dunbar Vocational Career Academy, graduating in 1999.
She cites Whitney Houston as her musical and movie influence, as well as Aretha Franklin.
She got her start in performing by singing with the church choir and doing community theatre.
Career
American Idol
Hudson auditioned for the third season of American Idol, in Atlanta, Georgia.
In her audition she commented that she had been singing on Disney Cruise Lines for the past few months (as one of the Muses from Hercules); and contestant judge Randy Jackson said, "We're expecting more than a cruise ship performance from you".
Jennifer delivered and all the judges agreed it was the best voice they had heard so far in the competition.
She was a member of the first group of semifinalists in the Semifinals.
She was not voted through to the final round, although she was brought back on the wild card round and put through as a "Top 12" finalist by Jackson.
Hudson struggled to gain popularity in the early stages of Idol's live shows, receiving the second-lowest number of votes in two of the first three shows.
However, after a change in song choices, she soon became a favorite to win, receiving the highest number of votes in the "Top 9" after her performance of Elton John's "Circle of Life," on April 6, 2004.
Among Hudson's worthy performances on the show was her rendition of Whitney Houston's, "I Have Nothing".
Contestant judge Simon Cowell commented that Hudson, "finally proved why she was among the 'Top 12,'" and referred to the performance a week later as, "sensational".
During the "Top 7" show, Hudson sang a show-stopping rendition of Barry Manilow's, "Weekend in New England," which garnered praise from all three judges.
Jackson called the song Hudson's best performance to date; and Simon Cowell noted that Hudson's presence made the third season a, "Battle of the Divas," referencing other powerful vocalists Fantasia Barrino and Latoya London.
Despite this praise, Hudson was eliminated during this week, which some blamed in part on a power outage in Hudson's hometown of Chicago due to storms and tornadoes in the area.
On April 21, 2004, Hudson became the sixth of the 12 finalists to be voted off the show, finishing the competition in seventh place.

Dreamgirls
In November 2005, Hudson was cast in the prized role of, "Effie White," the role originally created in a legendary Broadway performance by Jennifer Holliday, for the film adaptation of the musical Dreamgirls, which also starred Jamie Foxx, Beyoncé Knowles and Eddie Murphy.
This role marked Hudson's debut screen performance.
She won the role over hundreds of professional singers and actresses, including Raven-Symoné and American Idol winner Fantasia Barrino.
Filming of Dreamgirls began on January 9, 2006, and the film went into limited release on December 25, 2006, and national release on January 12, 2007.
Hudson has won particular praise for her show-stopping onscreen rendition of the hit song, "And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going", the signature song of the role, which had earlier been recorded, and had already reached the status of musical standard, because of the definitive performance of Jennifer Holliday.
The New York Observer described Hudson's performance of the song as, "five mellifluous, molto vibrato minutes that have suddenly catapulted Ms. Hudson... into the position of front-runner for the best supporting actress Oscar".
Newsweek said that when moviegoers hear Hudson sing the song, she, "is going to raise goose bumps across the land".
Variety wrote that Hudson's performance, "calls to mind debuts like Barbra Streisand in Funny Girl or Bette Midler in The Rose, with a voice like the young Aretha".
As Effie White, Hudson has garnered 29 awards from film critics as Best Supporting Actress and Breakthrough Performer of 2006.
She won the Golden Globe Award as Best Actress in a Supporting Role.
In addition, she has been named Best Supporting Actress by the Broadcast Film Critics Association and also by the Screen Actors Guild.
After seeing Hudson's performance in Dreamgirls, American Idol judge Simon Cowell taped a congratulatory message to her, which aired on The Oprah Winfrey Show.
With the March 2007 issue, Jennifer Hudson became the third African-American celebrity, and the first African-American singer, to grace the cover of Vogue magazine.
On February 25, 2007, she won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her role in this film.
At 25-years-old, Hudson became the eighth-youngest winner of the Best Supporting Actress Oscar.
Upon winning this award, Hudson also became one of the very few performers ever to win an Oscar for a debut screen performance.
As of 2009, she is also the only person to have gone from participating in a reality television series to becoming an Academy Award winner.
During her acceptance speech Hudson said:
Oh my God, I have to just take this moment in.
I cannot believe this.
Look what God can do.
I didn't think I was going to win.
[...] If my grandmother was here to see me now.
She was my biggest inspiration".
She also concluded her speech by thanking Jennifer Holliday.
Hudson's version of, "And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going," debuted at number 98 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the January 13, 2007, issue.
The Dreamgirls track has since become Hudson's first "Top 10" hit, but not on the "Hot 100," as the track registered a new peak at #7 on the Billboard "Hot Adult R&B Airplay" chart on February 24, 2007.
The track has also reached #14 on the "Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs" chart, and remixes of the song have seen Jennifer reach the #1 position on Billboard's "Hot Dance Club Play" chart.
In addition, Hudson was invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences on June 18, along with 115 other individuals for 2007.

Jennifer Hudson: (2006–present)
In November 2006, Hudson signed a record deal with Arista Records and has currently released her debut album and has recently finished recording one song entitled, "Depreciate".
In January 2008, it was announced that Hudson would be returning to the studio to record new material for her debut album.
Her label was reportedly unhappy with the direction they were sending Hudson musically and decided it would be best to scrap the older songs and instead focus on new ones.
Hudson worked with Ryan Tedder and Timbaland on a number of songs.
During an interview in May 2008, Hudson confirmed that her debut album, which will be self-titled, would be released on September 30, 2008, under the Arista Records label.
She also announced that later this month her debut single, "Spotlight," would be released in order to promote her debut album.

She has performed the song, "All Dressed in Love," for the Sex and the City soundtrack, which was released on May 27, 2008.
Hudson performed the national anthem at the 2008 Democratic National Convention.
Her debut album has attracted much attention including three nominations at the 2008 Grammy Awards.

She won one of the awards she was nominated for, Best R&B Album.
Hudson sang the National Anthem at Super Bowl XLIII..
The performance was lip-synced at the insistence of pre-game show producer Ricky Minor.
Although entertainers can perform live, Minor insisted that Hudson and Faith Hill, who sang "America the Beautiful" before the national anthem, use the tracks the NFL requires them to submit a week before the game.
Vocal profile
Hudson's voice spans from E3 to the soprano C (C6) while in her connected vocal register.
Her voice is in the mezzo soprano vocal range, however, her expansive upper register can also describe her as a dramatic soprano.
Her powerful rich voice in any aspect can be described as dramatic by any vocal category standard.
Her vocal influences include Aretha Franklin, Patti Labelle and Whitney Houston.
Hudson tends to avoid using her falsetto register in many of her songs; however, she has used this register in some of her songs, including a live cover of "Somewhere Over the Rainbow".
Personal life
Hudson began dating James Payton in 1999, when she was eighteen.
They were both from Chicago.
When asked if they had any plans to marry, Hudson declared that, "We are happy with the place we are right now, but perhaps we will tie the knot someday.
One thing's for sure, I definitely won't be popping the question!
" Sometime in December 2007 Hudson and Payton ended their relationship.
Hudson is now engaged to David Otunga, who is best known as "Punk" from I Love New York 2.
He proposed on Hudson's twenty-seventh birthday.
The couple have been dating for less than a year.
Otunga is reportedly training to become a professional wrestler.
'Family'
On October 24, 2008, Hudson's 57-year-old mother, Darnell Donerson, and the singer's 29-year-old brother, Jason, were shot to death inside Donerson's home, in Chicago, Illinois.
Likely shot before 3 p.m., they were discovered by Jason's cousin.
An AMBER Alert was issued for Hudson's 7-year-old nephew, Julian King, after Hudson's elder sister, Julia, reported him missing.
Later that day, Chicago police arrested a suspect, William Balfour, 27, the estranged husband of Hudson's sister Julia, but he was not charged with any crime.
Balfour is on parole and spent nearly seven years in prison for attempted murder, vehicular hijacking and possession of a stolen vehicle.
The Illinois Department of Corrections' records reveal one of Balfour's addresses to be the home where Donerson and Jason Hudson were murdered.
The body of a young boy was found in a 1994 Chevrolet Suburban parked on a street in Chicago's West Side area on October 27, 2008.
The license plate and the vehicle's description matched that of the AMBER Alert.
The FBI later confirmed the body was that of Julian King.
Autopsy reports released on October 29, 2008 from the Cook County Medical Examiner's office indicated that Julian King's death was due to "multiple gunshot wounds".
Hudson's family announced a foundation for families of murder victims.
The Hudson-King Foundation for Families of Slain Victims was named in honor of Hudson's mother, brother and nephew.
A weapon found in a West Side vacant lot in the neighborhood was confirmed as the murder weapon by Chicago police Superintendent Jody Weis on October 31, 2008.
Funeral services for the victims were on November 3, while a private service was held at Chicago's South Side Apostolic Church of God on November 10.
Because he had not yet been charged, Balfour appeared at a thirty-five minute parole hearing, on November 10, 2008, without an attorney; the hearing decision was that he was believed to have violated parole and should be held until a December 3 hearing before the full Illinois Prisoner Review Board.
Jeanetta Cardine, a prisoner review board executive, was informed at the hearing that a woman described as Balfour's current or former girlfriend has told investigators she saw him with a gun matching the description of the.45-caliber weapon used in the 3 killings.
Chairman Jorge Montes ruled: "He seemed to be disturbed.
He contested those allegations.
He was protesting the introduction of that evidence and he denied it.
The gun allegation alone was enough to keep the man in custody.
That's a very serious allegation.
If somebody's alleging they saw him with a gun that was used in the murder of three individuals, we would definitely hold.
The information about the woman's statements came from the Cook County State's Attorney's office".
Balfour's girlfriend stated that she "had seen him with a gun identical to the gun recovered by the Chicago police near the body of the murdered child" several days before the murders occurred.
She also claims Balfour admitted to being involved in the killings.
However, Balfour insisted he had nothing to do with the death of Julian King.
Balfour became the prime suspect of the murders on December 1, 2008, and was transferred into police custody.
A police department spokesperson said, "He is awaiting formal charges for three counts of murder.
There likely will be a press conference once there are formal charges against him".
Balfour was officially charged with three counts of first degree murder, one count of home invasion and was denied bail.
On February 1, 2009, Hudson made her first public appearance since the murders, singing the Star-Spangled Banner at Super Bowl XLIII.
The performance is available via iTunes, with a portion of the proceeds going to the Hudson-King Foundation.
