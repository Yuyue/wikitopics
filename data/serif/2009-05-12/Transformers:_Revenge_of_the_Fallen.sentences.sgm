Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is an upcoming science fiction/action film due for release on June 24, 2009.
It is the sequel to 2007's Transformers, which was the first live action Transformers film.
Michael Bay and Steven Spielberg return respectively as director and executive producer, while Shia LaBeouf reprises the role of Sam Witwicky, the human caught in the war between Autobots and Decepticons.
The film introduces many more robots and the scope has been expanded to numerous countries, the most important of which is Egypt.
The main hurdle in getting the film produced was overcoming the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike, as well as possible strikes by the Directors Guild of America and the Screen Actors Guild.
Bay finished his production on time with the help of previsualization and a scriptment by his writers Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman, and series newcomer Ehren Kruger.
Shooting from May to November 2008 predominantly took place in the United States, including the majority of scenes set in outside countries, a minimum of which was conducted in those actual nations.
Premise
Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) discovers something about the origins of the Transformers and their history on Earth after receiving visions from a remaining piece of the Allspark.
The evil Decepticons need to capture him for information.
The climactic battle takes place at the Giza pyramid complex, where a temple is located within.
Lorenzo di Bonaventura explained the film will start before the pyramids were built, tying the Transformers to the beginning of civilization, and implying that "all our heroes end up here because of the Decepticons' master plan".
Furthermore, Egyptian hieroglyphs resembling helicopters and other present day vehicles in real life will be explained in the film as being depictions of those Ancient Cybertronians who visited Earth.
Bay explained the battle at Mission City did not expose the Transformers to the public.
"Everybody has gone ahead.
It's realistic.
Two weeks after the tsunami nobody talked about it anymore.
It's very weird.
We decided to do the same with the Transformers.
The government talks about a military thing, says all is false, that it's a joke, and people don't know what they really saw".
Orci cited the Phoenix Lights incident as an inspiration for how the Transformers manage to stay covert after the previous film, and added it was an interesting idea for how would the government "hide Optimus Prime".
The human soldiers have joined the Autobots' ranks in a team called NEST (Networked Elements: Supporters and Transformers).
A government front called McClaren Robotics covers up the robot sightings, and they have an Allspark shard kept in storage in Diego Garcia.
Production
Development
In September 2007, Paramount announced a late June 2009 release date for the sequel to Transformers, and Bay began creating animatics of action sequences featuring characters rejected for the first film.
This would allow animators to complete sequences if the Directors Guild of America went on strike in July 2008 (which did not happen as the DGA signed a new deal).
The director considered making a small project in between Transformers and its sequel, but knew "you have your baby and you don't want someone else to take it".
The film was given a $200 million budget, which was $50 million more than the first film, and some of the action scenes rejected for the original were written into the sequel, such as the way Optimus is reintroduced in this film.
Lorenzo di Bonaventura said the studio proposed filming two sequels simultaneously, but he and Bay concurred that was not the right direction for the series.
Writers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman originally passed on the sequel because of a busy schedule.
The studio began courting other writers in May 2007, but as they were unimpressed with their pitches, they convinced Orci and Kurtzman to return.
The studio also signed on Ehren Kruger, as he impressed Bay and Hasbro president Brian Goldner with his knowledge of the Transformers mythology, and because he was friends with Orci and Kurtzman.
The writing trio were paid $8 million.
Screenwriting was interrupted by the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike, but to avoid production delays the writers spent two weeks writing a treatment, which they handed in the night before the strike began, and Bay expanded the outline into a sixty-page scriptment, fleshing out the action, adding more jokes, as well as selecting the majority of new characters.
The three writers spent four months finishing the screenplay while "locked" in two hotel rooms by Bay: Kruger wrote in his own room and the trio would check on each others' work twice a day.
Orci described the film's theme as "being away from home", with the Autobots contemplating living on Earth as they cannot restore Cybertron, while Sam goes to college.
He wanted the focus between the robots and humans "much more evenly balanced", "the stakes [to] be higher", and more focused on the science fiction elements.
Lorenzo di Bonaventura said that in total, there are around forty robots in the film, while ILM's Scott Farrar has said there is actually sixty.
Orci added he wanted to "modulate" the humor more, and felt he managed the more "outrageous" jokes by balancing it with a more serious plot approach to the Transformers' mythology.
Bay concurred that he wanted to please fans by making the tone darker, and that "moms will think its safe enough to bring the kids back out to the movies" despite his trademark sense of humor.
Kurtzman created the film's title.
The filmmakers considered incorporating the comics' character of G. B. Blackrock, but Bay considered the name too cartoonish.
Filming
Filming began in Los Angeles, California in May 2008.
The former Hughes Aircraft soundstages at Playa Vista served for filming the majority of interior scenes.
From June 2, three days were spent on an action sequence at the Bethlehem Steel site in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, which was used to represent a portion of Shanghai.
Afterwards, they shot at the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center.
The crew moved to Philadelphia on June 9, where they shot at the Exelon power plant on Delaware Avenue, the University of Pennsylvania, Drexel University, the Eastern State Penitentiary, Fairmount Park, Philadelphia City Hall, Rittenhouse Square and historic Chancellor Street (which represents a street near Place de la Concorde in Paris), and Wanamaker's.
They moved to Princeton University on June 22.
Filming there angered some students at the University of Pennsylvania, believing Bay had chosen to reshoot scenes at Princeton and script Princeton's name in the movie.
However, neither the University of Pennsylvania nor Princeton gave Bay permission to be named in the film because of a "funny 'mom' scene" that both felt "did not represent the school".
Bay scheduled a break for filming beginning on June 30, turning his attention to animation and second unit scenes because of the potential 2008 Screen Actors Guild strike.
Shooting for the Shanghai battle later continued in Long Beach, California.
The crew shot at Holloman Air Force Base and White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico during September.
The two locations were used for Qatar in the first film, and stood in for Egypt in this film.
A scale model in Los Angeles was also used for some close-ups of the pyramids.
Shooting at Tucson International Airport and the 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group's aircraft boneyard took place in October under the fake working title Prime Directive (a reference to Star Trek).
This location was delayed from July.
Filming also took place at Camp Pendleton and Davis-Monthan Air Force Base.
The first unit (including Shia LaBeouf) then shot for three days in Egypt itself, at the Giza pyramid complex and Luxor.
For security's sake, the shoot was highly secretive, but according to Lorenzo di Bonaventura, a crew of 150 Americans and "several dozen local Egyptians" ensured a "remarkably smooth" shoot.
Bay earned the Egyptian government's approval to film at the pyramids by contacting Zahi Hawass, who Bay recalled "put his arm around me and said, 'Don't hurt my pyramids.
'" A fifty foot tall camera crane was used at the location.
Four days were then spent in Jordan, where the Royal Jordanian Air Force aided in filming at Petra, Wadi Rum and Salt.
Filming continued at the Place de la Concorde in Paris, with the second unit taking shots of the Eiffel Tower and the Arc de Triomphe.
The cast and crew finished on the aircraft carrier USS John C. Stennis on November 2, 2008.
Bay stated he found the climax of the first film to be weak, partly because it was shot across five different city blocks, making the action confusing and hard to follow.
On this film, the final battle in Egypt was devised to make it easier to see what was going on.
Effects
Hasbro became more involved in the designs of the robots than in the first film.
They insisted on keeping the alternate modes of some of the returning characters similar, so people would not have to buy toys of the same characters.
Bay utilized real F-16 Fighting Falcon and tank fire when filming the battles.
Many of the new Autobot cars supplied by General Motors were brightly colored to look distinctive on screen.
The filmmakers made the new cars themselves because GM lacked the resources.
Scott Farrar returned as visual effects supervisor, and anticipated moodier use of lighting as well as deeper roles for the Decepticons.
He stated that with the bigger deadline, post-production will be a "circus".
The producers expected that with a bigger budget and the special effects worked out, the Transformers would have a larger role.
Peter Cullen recalled, "Don Murphy mentioned to me, 'Only because of the tremendous expense to animate Optimus Prime, he'll be in just a certain amount of [the first film].
' But he said, 'Next time, if the movie is a success, you're gonna be in it a ton.
Michael Bay hoped to include more close-ups of the robots' faces.
Farrar said the animators implemented more "splashes and the hits and the fighting on dirt or moving, banging into trees, [...] things splinter and break, they [the robots] spit, they outgas, they sweat, they snort".
Because of the sequences shot in the higher resolution of IMAX, it took several days to render a frame of animation.
Orci hinted the majority of the Decepticons were entirely computer-generated in both robot and alternate modes, which would make it easier to write additional scenes for them in post-production.
Music
Steve Jablonsky returned to compose the score for Revenge of the Fallen.
He and his producer Hans Zimmer will be utilizing a song by Linkin Park –whose song "What I've Done" was used in the first film– called "New Divide", composing various interpretations of it for the score.
Cast and characters
Humans
Shia LaBeouf plays Sam Witwicky, the teenager who killed Megatron.
In this movie, Sam is trying to get some personal development, and have a normal kid's life, getting over his world-saviour status, and out of the overprotection from his parents and Bumblebee.
He attends an East Coast college to learn astronomy.
During his time there, Sam starts having mental flashes about Cybertronian symbols that turn out to be the key to finding a source of Energon on Earth, so now the Decepticons are after him to get that information.
On July 27, 2008, LaBeouf was involved in a car crash, with fellow actress Isabel Lucas, and had to undergo hand surgery.
The character getting burned in the story was an unrelated decision.
LaBeouf said production was only delayed by two days after his accident because Bay made up for it by filming second unit scenes, and he recovered from the accident a few weeks earlier than expected, allowing him to return to the set.
Bay had suggested the hand injury will be written into the story, but Orci said on-set rewrites were done to protect his hand for the remainder of the shoot.
Towards the end of filming though, LaBeouf injured his eye when he hit a prop, which required seven stitches.
He resumed filming two hours later.
Megan Fox plays Mikaela Banes, Sam's girlfriend, who cannot afford to attend college with him, and gets a job at a motorcycle repair shop.
Fox cannot ride bikes in reality and had to have someone push her vehicle around as she rode on them.
Fox had lost a lot of weight for her role in Jennifer's Body, and had to gain ten pounds within three weeks.
She explained "Michael doesn't like skinny girls".
Josh Duhamel plays Captain William Lennox, a U.S. Army Ranger and ally of the Autobots.
Since the first film Lennox has become part of NEST, an international taskforce battling Decepticons with the Autobots.
Tyrese Gibson plays Robert Epps, a U.S. Air Force Combat Controller and a member of NEST.
He has been promoted to the rank of Master Sergeant.
John Turturro plays Reggie Simmons, former agent of the terminated Sector 7 unit, which monitored Transformer activity on Earth.
He is now off-duty, working in his mother's deli restaurant when Sam enlists his aid.
Turturro was allowed to climb the real pyramids during filming.
Matthew Marsden plays Graham, a member of the United Kingdom Special Forces who joins NEST.
Marsden grew up reading the comics and loved the first film.
Bay was impressed with his audition and decided to increase the character's screentime.
Ramon Rodriguez plays Leo Spitz, Sam's college roommate who owns a website on conspiracy theories.
He accompanies Sam and Mikaela all the way to Egypt.
Rodriguez endured 100 mph winds created by fans while filming in Egypt, which resulted in him dislocating his shoulder and having to spend 45 minutes having his eyes flushed of sand.
Steve Tom has a "principal" role, according to his website.
Kevin Dunn and Julie White play Ron and Judy Witwicky, Sam's parents.
They learned the truth about the Transformers while off-screen in the last film.
The Witwickies go on vacation to Paris and get caught up in the war by themselves.
Rainn Wilson cameos as a university professor, while Kym Whitley, John Benjamin Hickey and Glenn Morshower have unnamed roles (Morshower also had a cameo in the first film's opening action sequence).
Bay wanted Amaury Nolasco to return as soldier Jorge Figueroa, who was wounded by Scorponok in the first film, but Nolasco was not able to participate due to schedule conflicts, though this does not rule out a return in any upcoming sequels.
Autobots
Peter Cullen voices Optimus Prime, the Autobot leader.
He retains his alternate mode of a blue Peterbilt truck with red flame decals.
Cullen recorded a voiceover for the opening scene in August 2008, but began the majority of voice work in November.
A live action cameo has been written for Cullen.
Mark Ryan voices Bumblebee, the Autobot who befriended Sam and disguises himself as his fifth-generation Chevrolet Camaro.
Ryan also continued his role as stand-in for the robots on set.
Bumblebee's voice is still healing and he still uses radio soundbites to express some of his emotions.
Sam cannot take him to college as they do not allow freshmen to have cars on campus, and he'll also be forced to leave the Witwickies' garage due to an incident that resulted in Bumblebee wrecking their house.
The filmmakers used the Super Sport version of the 2010 Camaro rather than the concept version.
Ed Welburn, vice president of GM Global Design, said the redesigned car emphasized Bumblebee as becoming stronger after having his severed legs reattached in the first film: the new intakes and spoilers show he is a sturdier character.
Jess Harnell voices Ironhide, the Autobot weapons specialist who transforms into a GMC Topkick.
Robert Foxworth voices Ratchet, the Autobot medic who transforms into a search and rescue Hummer H2.
John Turturro voices Jetfire, a former Decepticon who transforms into a SR-71 Blackbird.
His wounds and age have made him choose to become an Autobot.
He can combine with Optimus, as they did in the Transformers: Armada series, which provides Optimus with the ability to fly.
The writers wanted a geriatric robot, and during scripting they gave Jetfire that personality.
He walks using a cane, he creaks, does not transform well, and is said to be running out of Energon.
In the movie, he is found in the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center by Agent Simmons and Sam, who break into the museum at night and reactivate him by using the AllSpark shard.
Turturro offered to voice the character because he thought it would be a fun part.
The Sisters, three Autobots with feminine appearances and personalities.
Whether to explain robotic gender or not was something the writers were unsure about, and it remained undecided until post-production.
The motorcycle vehicle modes for the Sisters were provided by custom sportsbike builder retroSBK.
Arcee, a pink motorcycle.
Arcee was dropped from the first film due to concerns of her being too small compared to the other bots, and the fact that the writers felt there was not enough time to explain her "gender", although she and several other female Transformers appeared in the first film's toy line and tie-in comics.
Chromia, a blue motorcycle.
In the 1980s cartoon, Chromia was Ironhide's girlfriend, something reflected by the film version's toy biography, which states Chromia was "friends with Ironhide for centuries, and their reunion on Earth was one of the high points of the war for both of them.
Now they work side by side, hunting and destroying Decepticons.
Neither of them has ever been happier".
A currently unnamed purple motorcycle.
Mudflap and Skids, also known as the Twins, who transform respectively into a red Chevrolet Trax and green Chevrolet Beat.
Mudflap is very hyperactive, while Skids believes himself to be the smarter of the two and tries to come across as mature, but nevertheless appears unable to keep quiet.
Bay compared the message of the bumbling but heroic characters to the story The Little Engine That Could.
He chose the Beat and Trax for the Autobot twins because he thought those two small cars looked good together.
Ed Welburn added when they had designed the cars before Bay selected them, the "character" they wanted to bring to the concepts was a sense that small cars could be as cool as large ones.
The Twins have the ability to combine.
They start the film by combining into a pink and white ice cream van, and at some point they combine to form a bigger robot.
Sideswipe, a silver Chevrolet Corvette Stingray Concept.
Jolt, a blue Chevrolet Volt.
Being an electric car, Jolt's weapons are a pair of electric whips.
He was a last-minute addition to the cast as General Motors, the film's car supplier, wanted to promote the Volt.
The writers had already wanted to include the car in the script before the Writers Guild strike, so they had to work out a character that would fit well within the Autobot team afterwards and convince Bay to approve the addition.
Welburn was pleased the Volt's character was christened Jolt by the filmmakers, as it reflected that car's design "character".
Wheelie, a small radio-controlled monster truck.
Wheelie initially serves the Decepticons, but because he is frightened of them he joins the Autobots.
Decepticons
Hugo Weaving voices Megatron, the Decepticon leader.
Killed and thrown into the Laurentian Abyss in the first film, he is resurrected by the Constructicons with dead robots' parts as a Cybertronian tank.
He has become stronger as a result of absorbing the Allspark fragments that originally killed him.
When reviving the character, the writers chose not to rename him Galvatron so as to not confuse the general audience.
Charlie Adler voices Starscream, the air commander who transforms into an F-22 Raptor.
He flew into space at the end of the previous film, and now returns bearing Cybertronian symbols on his body and commanding a new Decepticon army.
Orci confirmed he will have more dialogue.
Chris Mowry, writer of the comic book prequels, stated Starscream differs from his 1980s incarnation because "His motivations are more for the species.
He's definitely at odds with what Prime and Megatron have been doing.
He thinks that they've both been consumed with greed, for their own selfish reasons, but as he finds out, his plans start to fall through as he’s kind of becoming overwhelmed with the same greed that they had".
However, Orci explained that during post-production, dialogue additions edged Starscream closer towards his 1980s counterpart.
Frank Welker voices Soundwave, Megatron's intelligence officer.
He transforms into a Cybertronian craft with jet and satellite capabilities.
The concept artists also designed an Earth form of a Chevrolet Silverado for him to upgrade into, which Orci stated was dropped.
In the 1980s toyline, Soundwave's alternate mode was a micro-cassette player.
The filmmakers had tried to work him into the first film twice, and these roles eventually evolved into Blackout and Frenzy.
The latter character was particularly thought to be too different from the original.
Welker voiced Soundwave in the original cartoon.
Ravage, a minion that resembles a large one-eyed cat.
A robot resembling Frenzy, but with a cat like face, dreadlocks, and a bird-like beak.
Blackout and Scorponok, an MH-53 Pave Low helicopter and his scorpion-like minion.
Lennox killed Blackout in the first film, but he has been resurrected alongside Megatron, while Scorponok had been hiding in the desert and repaired his tail.
The Fallen.
One of the original thirteen Transformers, the robot known as The Fallen is the one who corrupted Megatron into forming the Decepticons.
He is trapped in another dimension and was able to communicate with the Decepticons via an interdimensional window.
It was the Fallen's face, distorted by this window, that inspired the image the Decepticons would use as their insignia.
Lorenzo di Bonaventura compared the Fallen to Judas Iscariot.
He transforms into a Cybertronian aircraft.
The writers selected the Fallen after looking through various cartoons and comics for new characters, because he was the most "elemental" villain.
Orci and Kurtzman approached Leonard Nimoy, who they had collaborated on the J.J. Abrams-directed Star Trek with, about voicing the part; Nimoy voiced Galvatron in 1986's The Transformers: The Movie and is also married to Bay's aunt Susan.
Orci said Welker might take on the role due to "fan outcry".
Bay was apprehensive about approaching Nimoy as "I just feel kind of bad about asking him.
Like 'I can't pay you that much, but would you do this voice?
'" During a press conference for Star Trek, Nimoy answered that the director should "Call me!
" He also said he had heard that Bay was afraid to get a hold of him "for some reason", but he would gladly be a part of Transformers again.
Demolishor, a predominantly white Terex O&K RH 400 hydraulic mining excavator, who is the protector of a small Decepticon community in Shanghai.
The writers simply called him "Wheelbot".
The Constructicons / Devastator, a 100 to 120 foot tall warrior formed by several combining construction vehicles, who walks in a four-legged fashion resembling a gorilla.
His jaws can open up to form some sort of suction vortex, and he seems to have grappling hooks he is seen using to climb a pyramid.
In the first film, the name "Devastator" was mistakenly given to Brawl, a tank.
In the theatrical trailer for the movie, Long Haul, Mixmaster, and two unidentified Constructicons are seen heading down to the bottom of the ocean in hunt of Megatron's corpse, ultimately reactivating their fallen leader.
Scavenger, a Terex O&K RH 400 hydraulic mining excavator.
He forms Devastator's torso.
Hightower, transforms into a yellow Kobelco CK2500 crawler crane and forms the left arm.
Long Haul, a green Caterpillar 773B dump truck, which forms the right leg.
Long Haul's individual robot mode was designed by freelance artist Josh Nizzi as fan art of the original character.
The fan art impressed Bay enough to hire him on to the film.
Mixmaster, who transforms into a black and silver Mack concrete mixer truck.
He forms the head.
Rampage, a yellow Caterpillar D9 bulldozer who forms the left leg.
Scrapper, a yellow Caterpillar 992G scoop loader who forms the right arm.
Overload
Sideways, an Audi R8.
Scalpel, a small, spider-like robot who turns into a microscope.
He is a medic and scientist equipped with tools he is seen using to torture Sam.
The other Decepticons call him "the Doctor".
The packaging of his Scout-Class figure details he is skilled in disecting and rebuilding almost any living organism.
Isabel Lucas plays Alice, a Pretender who stalks Sam.
There will be other minor robots, including Insecticons, some robots who can transform into weapons and some cooking appliances brought to life by the AllSpark shard, including the toaster bot from the Mountain Dew tie-in advert for the first film.
Release and marketing
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen will be released in regular and IMAX theaters on June 24, 2009, with the world premiere set to take place on June 8 in Tokyo, Japan.
Three of the action sequences were shot with IMAX cameras.
Orci mentioned in an August 2008 posting that the IMAX footage would be 3D, although when IMAX officially announced the use of their technology on the project, no mention was made of 3D.
Bay later revealed that he found 3D gimmicky, adding he was an "old school" filmmaker.
He added that IMAX was easier to use than stereoscopic cameras.
Hasbro's Revenge of the Fallen toy line will include new molds of new and returning characters, as well as 2007 figures with new mold elements or new paint schemes.
The first wave will be released on May 30, although Bumblebee and Soundwave will debut beforehand.
The second wave is due in August 2009, which introduces toys such as 2 1/4-inch human action figures that fit inside the transforming robots, and non-transforming replicas of the cars which can be used on a race track.
The combining Devastator toy will not come out until August.
Luxoflux is developing a video game based on the film, which Activision will publish.
Product placement partners on the film include Burger King, LG phones, Kmart, Wal-Mart, YouTube, Nike, Inc. and M&M's.
General Motors' financial troubles will limit its involvement in promotion of the sequel, although Paramount acknowledged with or without GM, their marketing campaign was still very large and had the foundation of the first film's success.
Kyle Busch will drive a Revenge of the Fallen/M&M's decoed car at Infineon Raceway on June 21, 2009, while Josh Duhamel will drive a 2010 Camaro at the Indianapolis 500.
Chris Mowry and artist Alex Milne, who collaborated on The Reign of Starscream comic book, will reunite for IDW Publishing's prequel to the film.
Originally set to be a five part series entitled Destiny, it was split into two simultaneously published series, Alliance and Defiance.
Alliance is drawn by Milne and began in December 2008: it focuses on the human and Autobot perspectives.
Defiance, which started the following month, is drawn by Dan Khanna and is set before either film, showing the beginnings of the war.
Simon Furman is writing the comic book adaptation of the film, while Alan Dean Foster is writing the novelization.
Foster is also writing The Veiled Threat, bridging both films, which was originally entitled Infiltration.
Foster collaborated with IDW to make sure his novels did not contradict their stories.
During production, Bay attempted to create a misinformation campaign to increase debate over what Transformers would be appearing in the film, as well as to try to throw fans off from the story of the film.
However, Orci confessed it had generally not been working.
The studio went as far as to censor MTV and Comic Book Resources interviews with Mowry and Furman, who confirmed Arcee and The Fallen would be in the picture.
Bay told Empire that Megatron would not be resurrected, claiming his new tank form was a toy-only character, only for Orci to confirm Megatron would return in the film in February 2009.
Bay also claimed he faked leaked daily call sheets from the first week of filming, that revealed Ramon Rodriguez's casting, and the appearance of Jetfire and the Twins.
Sequel
As a preemptive measure, Paramount and DreamWorks announced a July 1, 2011 release date for a third Transformers film before completion of Revenge of the Fallen.
Bay responded, "I said I was taking off a year from Transformers.
Paramount made a mistake in dating Transformers 3 - they asked me on the phone - I said yes to July 4 - but for 2012 - whoops!
Not 2011!
That would mean I would have to start prep in September.
No way.
My brain needs a break from fighting robots".
Like Revenge of the Fallen, Orci refused to guarantee whether he and Kurtzman would return to a sequel, because "we risk getting stale".
Orci has mentioned he would like to introduce Unicron "for scale's sake".
The co-writer also said introducing Triple Changers would be interesting.
Before Transformers was released, producer Tom DeSanto had "a very cool idea" to introduce the Dinobots, while Bay was interested in an aircraft carrier, which was dropped from the first film.
Orci claimed they did not incorporate these characters into Revenge of the Fallen because they could not think of a way to justify the Dinobots' choice of form, and were unable to fit in the aircraft carrier.
Orci also admitted he was also dismissive of the Dinobots because he does not like dinosaurs ("I recognize I am weird in that department," he said), but he became fonder of them during filming because of their popularity with fans.
He added "I couldn't see why a Transformer would feel the need to disguise himself in front of a bunch of lizards.
Movie-wise, I mean.
Once the general audience is fully on board with the whole thing, maybe Dinobots in the future".
