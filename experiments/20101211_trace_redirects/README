Beginning
=========

Found that the sentences of some files have only the text 'REDIRECT [redirected page title]'

e.g.
2009-04-19/Lawrence_Kutner.sentences
REDIRECT Lawrence Kutner (House, M.D.
character)

e.g.
2009-10-12/2004_Indian_Ocean_earthquake.sentences
REDIRECT 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami

Development
===========
Looked up the redirect files. Found that the redirected pages are the end link in the redirect links.
Then, why their text are redirecting to another page? Furthermore, the page to which they are redirected
are one the redirect pages redirected to the end link.

Look at the following examples:
2004_Indian_Ocean_earthquake_and_tsunami 2004_Indian_Ocean_earthquake
# Perfect example.

Lawrence_Kutner_(House,_M.D._character) Lawrence_Kutner_(House)
# This was wrong, and I missed it.

e.g.
$ grep Lawrence_Kutner redirects.txt
Dr._Kutner Lawrence_Kutner
Dr._Kuttner Lawrence_Kutner
Dr._Lawrence_Kutner Lawrence_Kutner
Dr._Lawrence_Kuttner Lawrence_Kutner
Dr_Kutner_(House) Lawrence_Kutner_(House)
Lawrence_Kutner_(House,_M.D._character) Lawrence_Kutner_(House)
Lawrence_Kuttner Lawrence_Kutner

To summarize, Lawrence Kutner and Lawrence Kutner (House) are both end links of
different sets of pages. The former is the disambiguation page, and the latter is
the page about the TV series's character.

This is clear that the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake page is the end link of all related pages.

Trial
=====
1. I thought that there might be a discrepancy of the database between 2010-06-22's and today's.
-> Tried to run fetch_article.py (src/wiki/...)
-> Failed: the Wikipedia API might have been changed.

2. Looked into the history from the Wikipedia website:
(e.g. http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lawrence_Kutner&action=history)
_> Found the items reading 'moved...'

e.g.
Lawrence_Kutner

Conclusion
==========
The Lawrence Kutner page was renamed later after it was selected in April, 2009 and its
title was changed later. The 2004 Indian Ocean eearthquake and tsunami page was also
moved later after it was selected in October, 2009.

The both articlecs exist as of the selected date for each, but their names were changed later.
However, when trying to fetch those articles, the text are not fetched and instead the text 'REDIRECT [another page]' is fetched.
But the redirect data in the database remains the same as before their names were changed.
