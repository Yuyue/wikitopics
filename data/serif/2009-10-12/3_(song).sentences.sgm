"3" is a song by American pop singer Britney Spears, from her upcoming second greatest hits compilation, The Singles Collection.
It was released  as the lead single of the album on September 29, 2009 by Jive Records.
The song was produced by Max Martin and Shellback while Spears was on the Sweden stop of her tour.
"3" is an uptempo dance song, that features a heavy bassline and has influences of electropop and rave.
Lyrically, the track is about threesomes.
Background
"3" was produced by Swedish songwriter and producer Max Martin, who worked with Spears on earlier hits including "...Baby One More Time", "Oops!...I Did It Again", "Stronger" and more recently "If U Seek Amy".
Spears recorded the song in July 2009 while she was in Stockholm during the European leg of her The Circus Starring: Britney Spears tour.
Music and lyrics
"3" is an uptempo electropop song, which opens with classical Max Martin synths and vocal effects.
The chorus has been compared to a  "playground chant" and closes with an extended moan.
During the second part of the chorus, there is a reference to the folk group Peter, Paul & Mary.
During the middle eight, the song slows down with synthetic strings and bass beats, and the section ends with a beat similar to a four-on-the-floor.
"3" is about  threesomes.
Unlike "If U Seek Amy", the song has no double entendre and it’s more straightforward lyrically.
The innuendo in the lyrics such as "Merrier the more, triple fun that way" have been compared to the songs in Prince’s Dirty Mind.
Critical response
"3" received positive reviews from music critics.
The song quickly drew comparisons to "If U Seek Amy".
According to Billboard, "If U Seek Amy" was an implied double-entendre, whereas "3" "finds Spears seductively delivering her most racy lyrics to date".
Digital Spy, the first major publication to review the song, described it as being "uptempo, quite electropoppy on the verses and a little bit ravey on the choruses".
Rolling Stone similarly praised the song for its up-tempo melody and racy lyrics and compared it to Flo Rida's recent work, saying that it "is more of a surefire dance-floor stomper than anything Brit loaded onto Blackout or Circus".
Entertainment Weekly called it "a fembot voice, near-seizure-inducing dance-floor frenzy".
Bill Lamb of About.com said that although the lyrics are controversial, "the bottom line is this is another irresistibly catchy pop confection that beats out most everything else on pop radio today".
He praised the chorus and the middle section and called the track "classic Britney".
The song was also compared to Madonna’s "Celebration", since they "musically present nothing particularly new, but they do manage to encapsulate many of the elements that make the singer a star".
