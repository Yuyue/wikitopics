fetch_sentences.py

Fetch wikipedia articles in plain text on a specified date.
It needs wiktrans to have been installed because it heavily uses
its sentence splitting module.

After you activate the virtual environments for wikitrans (e.g. by workon wt.dev)
you need to set the environment variable PYTHONPATH to the root directory
of the wikitrans project.

For example, the command for my environment is as below.
export PYTHONPATH=/Users/bahn/Desktop/wikitrans-system/wikitrans/wt-app/

The above path is for this module to import the manage module that resides
in the manage.py file under the specified directory.
The manage module in turn sets all necessary environment variables.
