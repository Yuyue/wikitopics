House (also known as House M.D.
) is an American medical drama series produced by David Shore and Bryan Singer.
The Pilot Episode premiered on Fox, a Terrestrial television network, on November 16, 2004.
The series revolves around Dr. Gregory House, a maverick medical genius who heads a team of diagnosticians at the fictional Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital in New Jersey.
House and his team use differential diagnosis to arrive at initial diagnoses, which are often wrong, on account of the unusual cases that Dr. House accepts.
House frequently clashes with his boss Dr. Lisa Cuddy, and his only friend, Dr. James Wilson.
After the pilot episode attracted approximately seven million viewers, it was quickly picked up for a full season of 22 episodes.

Seasons two and three both aired 24 episodes from September to May of the 2005-2006 and 2006-2007 television seasons respectively.
Season four, however, was cut short by the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike, and unfortunately aired only 16 of the planned 24 episodes.
The fifth season began airing on September 16, 2008.
In January 2009, House was moved to a new time slot: Monday night at 8:00pm EST, before 24.
