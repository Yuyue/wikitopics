?
=
- put the number of clusters into the tables in my paper (until Feb. 8)

Done
====
Sentence selection:
- show the output of different sentence selection schemes (Feb. 8)
- do manual sentence selection for the rest of the five days. (until Feb. 3)
- show inter-annotator agreement for manual sentence selection

Citation:
- put double curly braces around the title: NLTK, Twitter
- remove page information from conference papers
- abbreviate all the conference names
- delete see and the trailing period
- check if the page limit includes citation: checked. YES.

Style:
- spellcheck: showed->shown, sentencess->sentences


To Do
=====
Citation:
- look for research papers about wikipedia esp in aaai and write a short paragraph about them (until Feb. 3 or Feb. 8?)
- have a full page of citations
    - cite IR textbook, topic modeling paper, LDA, vector space model, TDT
    - cite Wikipedia papers
- cite papers about wsd, tdt, coref resolution, sentence fusion
- other tiny bits about citations

Description:
- mention the example of bruce springsteen clustered with grammy's award (until Feb. 8)

Figures:
- make sparkline graphs for super bowl and the captain sulley to possibly replace the current graph (until Feb. 8 deadline)

Major things:
- use edit histories for sentence selection
- write into the future work how to summarize a whole cluster or how a pair of things is related and discuss why it is difficult (until Feb. 3)
- revise the paragraph about Piracy with USS Bainbridge (DDG-96) and MV Maersk Alabama (until Feb. 8)
- remove trailing words by rewriting a paragraph to get extra space
- count the percentage of country names
- draw histogram of the increase in page views
- randomize order of Figure 1
- reduce the paragraph about Wikipedia current events

Minor things:
- do ensemble clustering (until Feb. 3)
- using Wikipedia categories to do the clustering (until Feb. 3)
- clustering with newswire data
- replace the example figure with 2011's events.
- ask Courtney about typesetting
- generate sentences for different selection algorithms

Introduction:
- maybe change figure 2
- revise the correlation between spikes and the day on which events are selected

Article Selection:
- add equation or pseudo code for article selection
- put histogram: better argument for why we should not use the current events from Wikipedia editors as gold standard

Clustering:
- give both relative and absolute #s for clustering performance results
- explain why some clustering methods fail (Piracy and Moldova)
- plot distribution of cluster size.
- average results across gold standard datasets

Sentence Selection:
- average results across gold standard datasets
- put error analysis that there are easy ones and hard ones
- improve date:
- put another feature: salience score based on tf-idf, sentence length

Style:
- summarize dataset and preprocess for article selection and clustering
    - remove technical details more appropriate for project report: preprocessing steps - redirects and casing, file format.
    
Related work:
- say how ours is different (relatively) static set of articles instead of constant stream of newswire
