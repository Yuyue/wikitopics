Penn was featured in the The Lonely Island's rejected MTV music video for "Awesometown", along with his friend Brandon Routh.
Penn says that he chose the stage name Kal Penn (from Kalpen Suresh Modi) as a lark: “Almost as a joke to prove friends wrong, and half as an attempt to see if what I was told would work (that anglicized names appeal more to a white-dominated industry), I put ‘Kal Penn’ on my resume and photos".
His audition callbacks rose by 50 percent.
Penn has stated that he prefers his birth name and uses "Kal Penn" only for professional purposes.
In January 2007, Penn appeared in the first four episodes of the sixth season of 24 as Ahmed Amar, a teenage terrorist.
Penn says he nearly turned down the role due to personal ethics, stating, "I have a huge political problem with the role.
It was essentially accepting a form of racial profiling.
I think it’s repulsive.
But it was the first time I had a chance to blow stuff up and take a family hostage.
As an actor, why shouldn’t I have that opportunity?
Because I'm brown and I should be scared about the connection between media images and people's thought processes?
"
