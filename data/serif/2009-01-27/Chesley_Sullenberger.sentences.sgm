Chesley Burnett "Sully" Sullenberger III (born January 23, 1951)  is an American commercial airline pilot, safety expert and accident investigator from Danville, California, who successfully carried out the emergency water landing of US Airways Flight 1549 on the Hudson River, offshore from Manhattan, New York City, on January 15, 2009, thus preventing any loss of life or significant property damage.
There were 155 people on the plane.
He is an international speaker on airline safety and has helped develop new protocols for airline safety.
Early life
Sullenberger was born to a dentist father – a descendant of Swiss immigrants named Sollenberger – and an elementary school teacher mother.
He has one sister, Mary Wilson.
The street on which he grew up in Denison, Texas, was named after his mother's family, the Hannas.
According to his sister, Sullenberger built model planes and aircraft carriers during his childhood, and might have become interested in flying after hearing stories about his father's service in the United States Navy.
He went to school in Denison, and was consistently in the 99th percentile in every academic category.
At the age of 12, his IQ was deemed high enough to join Mensa International.
He also gained a pilot's license at 14.
In high school he was the president of the Latin club, a first chair flute, and an honor student.
His high school friends have said that Sullenberger developed a passion for flying from watching jets based out of Perrin Air Force Base.
He graduated from Denison High School in 1969 near the top of his class of about 350.
Military service
Sullenberger enrolled at the United States Air Force Academy.
He was selected as one of around a dozen other freshmen for a cadet glider program, and by the end of that year, he was an instructor pilot.
He graduated with a B.S.
from the Academy in 1973, majoring in psychology and basic sciences and receiving a number of academic awards.
In his graduation year, he received the Outstanding Cadet in Airmanship Award, which is given to the top flier in each graduating class.
He served as a fighter pilot for the United States Air Force, piloting McDonnell (later McDonnell Douglas) F-4 Phantom II's from 1973 to 1980.
He advanced to become a flight leader and a training officer, and attained the rank of captain, with experience in Europe, the Pacific and at Nellis Air Force Base, as well as operating as Blue Force Mission Commander in Red Flag Exercises.
While in the Air Force, he was a member of the official aircraft accident investigation board.
Commercial pilot
Sullenberger has been employed by US Airways or its predecessor airlines since 1980.
(Pacific Southwest Airlines, or PSA, was acquired by US Air, later US Airways, in 1988.
) In total, he has more than 40 years of flying experience, and since 2007 has run his own safety consulting business, Safety Reliability Methods Inc., which provides "emergency management, safety strategies and performance monitoring to the aviation industry".
He has also been involved in a number of accident investigations conducted by the USAF and the National Transportation Safety Board, served as an instructor, Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA) safety chairman, accident investigator, and national technical committee member.
His safety work for the ALPA led to the development of a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Advisory Circular.
He was instrumental in developing and implementing the Crew Resource Management course that is used by US Airways, and he has taught the course to hundreds of other airline members.
Working with NASA scientists, he coauthored a paper on error-inducing contexts in aviation.
He has gained more than 19,000 hours of flight experience to destinations across North America, Europe and South America on Airbus A320s and similar planes since joining US Airways.
His résumé states that he was an air accident investigator for a National Transport Safety Board inquiry into a major accident at Los Angeles International Airport, which "led to improved airline procedures and training for emergency evacuations of aircraft".
Sullenberger has also been studying how to keep an airline crew functioning during a crisis.
He holds an Airline Transport Pilot License for single and multi-engine airplanes, and a Commercial Pilot License rating in gliders, as well as an expired flight instructor certificate for airplanes (single, multi-engine, and instrument), and gliders.
Flight 1549
On January 15, 2009, Sullenberger was pilot in command of an Airbus A320 from New York's LaGuardia Airport to Charlotte/Douglas International Airport in Charlotte, North Carolina.
The flight was designated as US Airways Flight 1549 as well as United Airlines Flight 1919.
However, after taking off, Sullenberger reported to air traffic control (ATC) that the plane had hit a large flock of geese, disabling both engines.
Several passengers saw the left engine on fire.
Sullenberger discussed with ATC the possibilities of either returning to LaGuardia or attempting to land at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey.
However, he quickly decided neither was feasible, and determined to ditch in the Hudson River.
Sullenberger told the passengers to "brace for impact", then piloted the plane to a smooth ditching in the river at about 3:31 P.M.  All passengers and crew members survived.
Sullenberger checked the plane cabin twice before being the last to evacuate the stricken aircraft.
The Mayor of New York City, Michael Bloomberg, said that Sullenberger and his crew will receive the "Key to the City".
A fan club dedicated to Sullenberger was created on the social networking website Facebook within hours of the news.
U.S. President George W. Bush called Sullenberger to thank him for saving the lives of the passengers, as did President-elect Barack Obama who also invited him to join the presidential inauguration ceremony.
On January 22, 2009, Sullenberger, along with the rest of the crew of Flight 1549 was awarded a Masters Medal by the Guild of Air Pilots and Air Navigators.
Academic life
In addition to his bachelor of science degree from the United States Air Force Academy, Sullenberger holds a master's degree in industrial psychology from Purdue University and a master's degree in public administration from the University of Northern Colorado.
He is a visiting scholar at the University of California, Berkeley, Center for Catastrophic Risk Management.
He was a speaker for two panels at the High Reliability Organizations (HRO) 2007 International Conference in Deauville, France, from May 29 to 31, 2007.
