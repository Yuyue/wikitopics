He earned various accolades following Tha Carter III, including being nominated for eight Grammy Awards.
He will release a rock album titled Rebirth in 2009.
Early life
Lil Wayne was born Dwayne Michael Carter, Jr. and grew up in the Hollygrove neighborhood of New Orleans, Louisiana.
Carter enrolled in the gifted program of Lafayette Elementary School and in the drama club of Eleanor McMain Secondary School.
He wrote his first rap song at age eight.
At age eleven, he met Bryan Williams, rapper and owner of Cash Money Records.
Lil Wayne recorded freestyle raps on Williams' answering machine; Williams would eventually mentor the young Carter and include him in Cash Money-distributed songs.
When he was 12, he played the part of the Tin Man in his middle school drama club's production of The Wiz.
He dropped out of school at age 14 but later earned his GED.
Music career
Hot Boys
In 1997, Lil Wayne formed the group Hot Boys along with rappers Juvenile, Turk, and B.G.
; at age 15, Wayne was the youngest member at that time.
Hot Boys' debut album Get It How U Live!
was released the same year, followed in 1999 by the group's major-label debut Guerrilla Warfare, which reached #1 on the Billboard magazine Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and #5 on the Billboard 200.
During their career, the Hot Boys had two charting singles, "We On Fire" from Get It How U Live!
and "I Need a Hot Girl" from Guerrilla Warfare.
Lil Wayne was also featured on Juvenile's single "Back That Azz Up", which reached #18 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #5 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks.
Let 'Em Burn, a compilation album of unreleased tracks recorded during 1999 and 2000, came out in 2003, several years after the group disbanded.
It reached #3 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and #14 on the Billboard 200.
Early solo career (1999-2003)
Lil Wayne's debut solo album Tha Block Is Hot at age 17 featured significant contributions from the Hot Boys and went double platinum, climbing to #3 on the Billboard album charts.
The album earned him a 1999 Source magazine award nomination for "Best New Artist", and also became a Top Ten hit.
The lead single was "Tha Block Is Hot".
After the release of Tha Block is Hot, Lil Wayne was featured on the single, "Bling Bling", with B.G., Juvenile, Turk, and Big Tymers.
His 2000 follow-up album Lights Out failed to attain the level of success achieved by his debut but was certified gold by RIAA.
Critics pointed to the lack of coherent narratives in his verses as evidence that he had yet to mature to the level of his fellow Hot Boys.
The lead single was "Get Off The Corner" which was noticed for an improvement in lyrical content and style, it also received a music video.
The second single which received less attention was "Shine" featuring The Hot Boys.
Near the release of Lights Out, Lil Wayne was featured on the single, "1# Stunna" with Big Tymers and Juvenile, which rose to 24th place on the Hot Rap Tracks charts.
Lil Wayne's third album 500 Degreez, released in 2002, followed the format of his previous two, with significant contributions from the Hot Boys and Mannie Fresh.
While certified Gold like its predecessor, it too failed to match the success of his debut.
The title was a reference to the recently estranged Hot Boys member Juvenile's recording, 400 Degreez.
The lead single was "Way Of Life" which like the album failed to match the success of his previous singles.
After the release of 500 Degreez, he was featured in the single "Neva Get Enuf" by 3LW.
