The Nobel Peace Prize (Norwegian and Nobels fredspris) is awarded annually by the Norwegian Nobel Committee "to the person who shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses".
It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the 1895 will of Alfred Nobel (who died in 1896), awarded for outstanding contributions in chemistry, physics, literature, peace, and physiology or medicine.
As dictated by Nobel's will, the award is administered by the Norwegian Nobel Committee and awarded by a committee of five people elected by the Norwegian Parliament.
The first Nobel Peace Prize was awarded in 1901 to Frédéric Passy and Jean Henry Dunant.
Each recipient receives a medal, a diploma and a monetary award prize that has varied throughout the years.
In 1901, Passy and Dunant shared a prize of 150,782 SEK, which is equal to 7,731,004 SEK as of December 2008.
In 2008, the prize was awarded to Martti Ahtisaari of Finland, who received the prize amount of 10,000,000 SEK (slightly more than €1 million, or US$1.4 million).
The Peace Prize is presented annually in Oslo, Norway, in the presence of the king, on December 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death, and is the only Nobel Prize not presented in Stockholm, Sweden.
The Nobel Peace Prize is generally the most controversial of the Nobel Prizes; several of the selections have been heavily criticized.
Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi never won the prize, despite having been nominated five times.
Following his assassination in 1948 the committee considered awarding it to him posthumously but decided against it and instead withheld the prize that year with the explanation that "there was no suitable living candidate".
In 1961, Dag Hammarskjöld, who died after his nomination but several months before the announcement, became the only Laureate to be recognized posthumously; following this, the statutes were changed to make a future posthumous prize nearly impossible.
In 1973, Lê Ðức Thọ declined the Nobel Peace Prize, because "he was not in a position to accept the Prize, citing the situation in Vietnam as his reason".
Linus Pauling, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate in 1962, is the only person to have been awarded two unshared Nobel Prizes; he won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1954.
The International Committee of the Red Cross has been awarded the prize three times (1917, 1944 and 1963), and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has won twice (1954, 1981).
Twelve women have won the Nobel Peace Prize, the most of any other Nobel Prizes.
As of 2008, the Peace Prize has been awarded to 96 individuals and 20 organizations.
There have been 19 years in which the Peace Prize was not awarded, the most of any other Nobel Prizes.
