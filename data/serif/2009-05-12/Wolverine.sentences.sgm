The wolverine (Gulo gulo) is the largest land-dwelling species of the Mustelidae or weasel family (the Giant Otter is largest overall) in the genus Gulo (meaning "glutton").
It is also called the Glutton or Carcajou.
Some authors recognize two subspecies: the Old World form Gulo gulo gulo and the New World form G. g. luscus.
A third subspecies limited to Vancouver Island (G. g. vancouverensis) is also occasionally described; however, craniomorphic evidence suggests that the Vancouver Island wolverines are properly included within G. g. luscus.
Anatomy
Anatomically, the wolverine is a stocky and muscular animal.
It has brown fur with stripes of dull yellow along the sides.
Its fur is long and dense and does not retain much water, making it very resistant to frost, which is common in the wolverine's cold habitat.
(For these reasons, the fur has been traditionally popular among hunters and trappers as a lining in jackets and parkas, especially for wear in Arctic conditions).
The adult wolverine is about the size of a medium dog, with a length usually ranging from 65 – 87 cm (25 – 34 inches), a tail of 17 – 26 cm (7 – 10 inches), and a weight of 10-25 kg (22 – 55 lb), although exceptionally large males can weigh over 31 kg (70 lb).
The males are as much as 30 percent larger than the females.
In appearance, the wolverine resembles a small bear with a long tail.
It has been known to give off a very strong, extremely unpleasant odor, giving rise to the nicknames "skunk bear" and "nasty cat".
Wolverines, like other mustelids, possess a special upper molar in the back of the mouth that is rotated 90 degrees, towards the inside of the mouth.
This special characteristic allows wolverines to tear off meat from prey or carrion that has been frozen solid.
Behavior
The wolverine is, like most mustelids, remarkably strong for its size.
It has been known to kill prey as large as moose, although most typically when these are weakened by winter starvation or caught in deep snow.
Wolverines inhabiting the Old World (specifically, Fennoscandia) are more active hunters than their North American cousins.
This may be because competing predator populations in Eurasia are not as dense, making it more practical for the wolverine to hunt for itself than to wait for another animal to make a kill and then try to snatch it.
They often feed on carrion left by wolves, so that changes in the population of wolves may affect the population of wolverines.
Wolverines are also known on occasion to eat plant material.
Armed with powerful jaws, sharp claws, and a thick hide, wolverines may defend kills against larger or more numerous predators.
There is at least one published account of a 27-pound wolverine's attempt to steal a kill from a black bear (adult males weigh 400 to 500 pounds).
Unfortunately for the mustelid, the bear won what was ultimately a fatal contest.
Wolverines have been known to harass and attempt to intimidate wolves and cougars.
Mating season is in the summer, but the actual implantation of the embryo (blastocyst) in the uterus is stayed until early winter, delaying the development of the fetus.
Females will often not produce young if food is scarce.
The wolverine gestation period is 30-50 days.
Litters of typically two or three young ("kits") are born in the spring.
Kits develop rapidly, reaching adult size within the first year of a lifespan that may reach anywhere from five to (in exceptional individuals) thirteen years.
Adult wolverines have no natural predators, though they do come into conflict with (and may be killed by) other large predators over territory and food.
Juveniles are more vulnerable; infants (kits) have been known on occasion to be taken by predatory birds such as eagles.
Range
The wolverine lives primarily in isolated northern areas, for example the arctic and alpine regions of Alaska, northern Canada, Siberia and Scandinavia; they are also native to Russia, the Baltic countries, and Northern China and Mongolia.
In 2008 and 2009, wolverines were sighted as far south as the Sierra Nevada, near Lake Tahoe, for the first time since 1922.  .
It is also found in low numbers in the Rocky Mountains and northern Cascades of the United States.
However, most New World wolverines live in Canada.
The world's total wolverine population is unknown.
The animal exhibits a low population density and requires a very large home range.
The range of a male wolverine can be more than 620 km² (240 sq mi) while encompassing the ranges of several females (with smaller home ranges of roughly 130-260 km² (50-100 sq mi).
Adult wolverines try for the most part to keep non-overlapping ranges with adults of the same sex.
Radio tracking suggests an animal can range hundreds of miles in a few months.
This requirement for large territories brings wolverines into conflict with human development, and hunting and trapping further reduce their numbers, causing them to disappear from large parts of their former range; attempts to have them declared an endangered species have met with little success.
Name
The wolverine's questionable reputation as an insatiable glutton (reflected in the Latin genus name Gulo) may be in part due to a false etymology.
The animal's name in old Swedish, Fjellfräs, meaning "fjell (mountain) cat," worked its way into German as Vielfraß, which means roughly "devours much".
Its name in other West Germanic languages is similar (e.g.
Dutch Veelvraat).
The Finnish name is Ahma, derived from ahmatti, which is translated as "glutton".
The Russian rosomakha and the Polish and Czech name rosomak, seem to be borrowed from the Finnish rasva-maha (fat belly).
Similarly, the Hungarian name is rozsomá or torkosborz which means gluttonous badger.
The animal's name žderavac in Bosnian and Croatian, as well as žderavac / ждеравац in Serbian literally means 'one that devours a lot' is likely a direct translation from German rather than a native word.
The natural habitat of the animal is far north of the Balkans where these languages are spoken; thus the need for a translated loan word.
Interestingly, the concept of purported gluttony is reflected in neither English nor Germanic Scandinavian languages.
The English word wolverine (alteration of the earlier form wolvering  of uncertain origin) probably implies 'a little wolf'.
The name in Old Norse, Jarfr, lives on in the regular Icelandic name jarfi, regular Norwegian name jerv, regular Swedish name järv and regular Danish name jærv.
As a symbol
Many cities, teams, and organizations use the wolverine as a mascot.
For example, the U.S. state of Michigan is, by tradition, known as "The Wolverine State," and the University of Michigan takes the wolverine as its mascot.
The association is well and long established: for example, many Detroiters volunteered to fight during the American Civil War and George Armstrong Custer, who led the Michigan Brigade, called them the "Wolverines".
The origins of this association are obscure: it may derive from a busy trade in wolverine furs in Sault Ste.
Marie in the 18th century or may recall a disparagement intended to compare early settlers in Michigan with the vicious mammal.
It is, at the least, an uncommon sight there: for example, when one was observed in February 2004. by hunters and biologists near Ubly, it was reportedly the first confirmed sighting of a wolverine in Michigan in 200 years.
The wolverine figures prominently in the mythology of the Innu people of eastern Québec and Labrador.
In at least one Innu myth, it is the creator of the world.
