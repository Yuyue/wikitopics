Satellite evidence from 2 April 2009 led ESA analysts to conclude that the collapse of the strip (which would result in a partial break-away from the Antarctic Peninsula) was "imminent".
On 5 April 2009, the ice bridge connecting part of the ice shelf to Charcot Island collapsed.
The breakaway is seen as firm evidence of the ongoing effects of warming.
