Underworld: Rise of the Lycans is the third installment in the Underworld series of films.
It is a prequel to Underworld and Underworld: Evolution, covering the origins of some characters.
Screen Gems released the film on January 23, 2009.
Plot
The film opens with a monologue by Sonja about the vampires and Lycans and how the vampires began enslaving the Lycans.
It also shows Lucian's birth from a captive Lycan and how Viktor spared him (killing the lycan mother), making him the first Lycan able to take human form.
It then fast forwards to Lucian's teen years as he spars with a group of Death Dealers and defeats them all.
Viktor, genuinely impressed, decides to make more Lycans for the benefit of the coven.
Unknown to Viktor, his young daughter, Sonja, develops an attraction to the young Lycan, and Lucian becomes fond of Sonja as well.
After the title, a Death Dealer is shown riding through a small chasm while being trailed by wild Lycans that are unable to assume human form, unlike their civil brethren.
When they make it to the field, more vampires begin shooting at the Lycans with ballista.
Lucian kills two Lycans just about to leap on the Dealer and kills one just as it enters the coven's walls.
Viktor comes out and the Dealer is revealed to be Sonja.
Viktor asks Lucian if he feels any remorse for his kind and Lucian replies with "they are mindless animals, no brethren of mine".
Lucian interferes as a slave master brutally beats a Lycan slave for transgressions.
The specieist slave master tells Lucian he will be there when Lucian falls.
After the slaves leave, Lucian sneaks into a small tunnel to a cliff, where he meets with Sonja and they make love.
Lucian asks Sonja if she would leave with him and she protests his leaving, but he is determined, and even shows her a key to his collar he made himself (the collar, due to its silver metal and deadly barbs, prevented him from transforming under Viktor's watch).
He proceeds to leave and exits the tunnel, unaware that Tanis, Viktor's right-hand man, is observing him.
As human nobles come to meet with the vampire council for protection from the wild wolves in exchange for a tithe, Sonja goes out to guard them.
Lucian hears the Lycans near Sonja and steals a horse and sword from a nearby Death Dealer.
The Lycans attack and kill the noble and Lucian fights them.
Raze is revealed to have been one of the noble's slaves.
He begins to fight off Lycans and sees Lucian take off his collar and change into a Lycan.
The wild Lycans back down to his howl and leave before he is shot down by Viktor's men.
Sonja protests and claims he only changed to save her life.
Viktor, feeling betrayed, locks Lucian away after whipping him 30 times with a three pronged chain-bladed whip.
Lucian becomes friends with Raze and speaks to Sonja about escape.
He informs her that Tanis knows about their relationship and tells her to use him to get help out of the coven without her father's knowledge.
Tanis agrees to assist them for Sonja's spot on the council, which would enable him to amass more political influence.
He gives Lucian the key to his collar and the same night, Raze is turned into a Lycan.
In the morning, Lucian escapes and kills the slave master and begins to free the other Lycans.
The guards are alerted and the liberated Lycans begin to be slaughtered by the Death Dealers' large crossbolts.
A majority of the Lycans are trapped and Lucian is forced to leave without them.
He and Raze begin finding "conscripts" for his "army" and even travels to the lair of the wild Lycans in order to forge an alliance between the two "rival" factions of wolf.
Viktor asks Tanis for the key to Lucian's collar and almost kills him for his apparent betrayal, but Tanis leads Viktor to the armory, claiming he locked it in there.
He reveals a regular key to Viktor, who believes it to be the real one.
Viktor then confronts Sonja about her relationship with Lucian.
He bites her and absorbs her memories, learning of her time with Lucian.
Infuriated at her illegal relationship, he locks her in the room and waits for Lucian.
Lucian tells Raze to keep the men together while he goes to the coven to free Sonja.
He frees her from her room but they get into a fight with Death Dealers along the way.
He is then surrounded by Dealers and Sonja fights Viktor, who subsequently loses after at first evading her strikes.
When Sonja tells her father that she is pregnant with Lucian's child, Viktor takes a knife to her throat and imprisons them again with newfound hatred.
After being condemned for her crimes against the coven, Sonja is sentenced to death at a trial presided over by her father and the Council, with Lucian watching in chains.
After she is burned alive by sunlight, Lucian escapes the chains and makes it to the stairs of the wall but is shot by Dealers.
He is shot several more times and calls out to the Lycans before he weakly transforms back into his human form.
All of the Lycans, of the first and second generations as well, amass and attack the coven, overwhelming it after a fierce battle.
Viktor orders Tanis to save the coffins of the Elders and goes out to fight the Lycans.
The Vampire Elder is able to slay a great deal of them with ease, but Lucian confronts him, causing Viktor to flee into a tunnel that leads to the prison.
They battle and the prison pit to the water opens, resulting in their downward descent.
Lucian accidentally pulls one of the rocks out, revealing sunlight.
Lucian then pulls enough out to have Viktor retreat to the side of the pit.
Lucian comes down to him and Viktor tells him he should have killed him at birth.
Lucian replies with "Yes, you should have, but you didn't", before stabbing Viktor in the mouth.
Lucian tosses Viktor's body in the water, thinking that he has killed him, but Elders do not perish so easily.
Lucian comes out to Raze, who tells him it is done, but Lucian replies, "No, this is just the beginning", implying that the war will never end until all of the other Vampire Elders have been slain by the Lycans, as he blames their leadership for the hardships that led to the current state of events.
Viktor, now on a ship with Tanis, locks himself in his coffin to regenerate.
The cycle of the Elders starts anew, whereby Amelia succeeds Viktor as the next reigning Elder.
The film ends with the opening scene of the first Underworld, with the audio from the scene where Kraven tells Selene that it was Viktor who murdered her family, rather than the Lycans.
That Viktor spared her because she reminds him of Sonja, the daughter he condemned to death.
The last word is played over the shot of her eyes: "Lies".
Production
In September 2003, shortly after the release of Underworld (2003), production companies Screen Gems and Lakeshore planned to release a prequel as the third film following Underworld's sequel, Underworld: Evolution (2006).
Kate Beckinsale, who portrayed Selene in Underworld, expressed interest in reprising her role for the sequel and the prequel.
In December 2005, Underworld: Evolution director Len Wiseman explained that the Underworld franchise was originally conceived as a trilogy.
Wiseman said, "We sort of mapped out an entire history and story... a massive collection of ideas and stories that we're putting out at certain times".
Wiseman anticipated creating a third installment for the franchise  based on the audiences' reception of Underworld: Evolution, which would be released the following month.
In a June 2006 interview, Wiseman said, "The third film is going to be a prequel.
It will be the origin story and we find out things we didn't know about Lucian; he'll have a much bigger part in it.
It will be about the creation [of the races] and what started the war.
It will be a period piece.
The movie will also focus for the first time through the Lycans' point of view".
The director also shared, "In terms of the writing, a lot of the writing has been done.
We've been developing Underworld 3 for a while.
I won't be directing Underworld 3; I'm just going to be producing and writing".
When asked if Kate Beckinsale would reprise her role as Selene in the prequel, Wiseman said, "It will be in the time period before, but it will overlap into the creation of her as well.
We're in the process of seeing how far we go with that".
The following October, actor Michael Sheen, who portrays Lucian in the film series, expressed interest in being part of the prequel.
The Hollywood Reporter announced on October 26, 2007 that the film will be written by Danny McBride and mark the directorial d√©but of Patrick Tatopoulos, who designed the creature effects for all three Underworld films.
Len Wiseman will produce, and contribute to the writing of this film, but will not direct, nor will Kate Beckinsale reprise her lead role of Selene nor will Scott Speedman reprise his role of Michael.
Additionally, Shane Brolly, who portrayed Kraven in the first and second films, does not appear in the theatrical release of the third film, despite being billed by film website  imdb.com.
The film was shot in Auckland, New Zealand and in Roxboro, North Carolina.
