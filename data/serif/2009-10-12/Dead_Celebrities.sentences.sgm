Plot
For a while, Ike has been seeing ghosts of dead celebrities such as Billy Mays.
Because Mays promoted "Chipotl-away" a fictional product that cleans blood stains from people's underwear caused by eating Chipotle, Cartman decides to help though Kyle is confused about why people eat Chipotle if it causes them to defecate blood.
The boys call Ghost Hunters to find the problem, but they get scared and instead end up urinating and defecating themselves thinking that it's actually paranormal activity.
After Ike ends up in a coma, a medium (based on Tangina from Poltergeist) comes to help the boys, managing to contact the spirits as they reveal they're trapped in Purgatory because Michael Jackson refuses to accept his death.
As the medium gets thrown out a window by the ghost's denial and killed, Jackson possesses Ike's body as the other spirits are forced to remain in Purgatory, which is revealed to be an airplane stuck on a metaphorical runway.
The only way to release Michael from Ike's body and to free the celebrities from Purgatory is for Michael to achieve his dream: being a "little white girl".
The boys enter Michael in a beauty pageant.
After Michael's singing performance, the two male judges love him, but the police arrest the two judges for pedophilia, leaving the female judge to decide the final outcome.
Cartman sees her eating chipotle and bribes her with the Chipotl-away.
An alien features in the pageant audience similar to other episodes of South Park.
Michael wins and his spirit leaves Ike's body and returns to Purgatory.
Purgatory then lifts off and takes all of the people to their destination, Hell.
To the annoyance of the dead celebrities, they are informed that Hell is a Tow gate.
