Futebol Clube do Porto (pron.
) - short: FC Porto, Porto or FCP - is a Portuguese sports club best known for its footballing endeavors.
It was founded in Porto in 1893.
FC Porto is the most lauded and successful international team in Portugal, with a national record of 6 international titles, becoming European and World Champions twice each in the 1987 and 2004 seasons.
In 1987, FC Porto also gained the UEFA Supercup (another first for Portugal) and, in 2003, it brought Portugal's first UEFA Cup.
In 1987, FC Porto became one of a few teams in the World to hold in possession 3 major international titles simultaneously (the only one in Portugal).
Domestically they hold the best record of five titles in a row, having won the Portuguese Liga 23 times, the Portuguese Cup 17 times and Portuguese Supercup 15 times (55 national titles).
The football home ground is the Estádio do Dragão, which replaced the previous home, Estádio das Antas, in 2003.
FC Porto is also a leading force in other sports: the handball and basketball teams are regular contenders for the national titles and the roller hockey section is amongst the best in the sport worldwide.
The new multi-sport arena near the stadium will be completed soon; in past years the non-professional home grounds were scattered around neighbouring cities (such as Gondomar, Matosinhos and Santo Tirso).
Supporters and players of the club are nicknamed portistas.
It was founded in the northern city of Porto on September 28, 1893, by wine-salesman António Nicolau de Almeida' who had his first contact with the game of football on one of his trips to England.
The club was revived in 1906 by Monteiro da Costa.
Commercially, the club has several stores called Loja Azul (English: Blue Store) scattered around the city, including two used with official supplier Nike.
Since 1994, a merchandising goods fair called Portomania is organized during the pre-season.
FC Porto publishes one of the older club-related publications in Europe: a monthly 60-page full-colour magazine called Dragões (Dragons) that has existed since the early 1980s.
FC Porto played in the Portuguese championship 74 times, playing 2048 games, winning 1333, drawing 375, losing 340, scoring 4542 goals and conceding 1909, having 3342 points as of the end of the 2007–08 season.
They were also one of the founding members of the now disbanded G-14.

History
Its first official trophy, the "Union of the North cup", was won in 1911.
In the following years it became one of the biggest clubs in Portugal and went on to win the first national competition in the history of Portuguese football, the Campeonato da Liga 1934/35.
Porto were always a struggling team after that championship, so they went to win only 5 championships in 41 years of dictatorship.
But after the Carnation Revolution, the history of Portuguese soccer saw a new title contestant, and a new European team.
In the following years, Porto won 18 titles, 10 Portuguese cups, 15 Portuguese supercups, 1 European Champions Cup and the new Champions League, 1 UEFA Cup, 1 European Super Cup, and 2 Intercontinental Cup.
A wonderful rise for a team that was used to, as was said at the time, starting away games 1–0 down.
Two of the biggest reasons for this change of fortunes were Pinto da Costa who took control of Porto in 1982 and José Maria Pedroto whom he had brought back with him to manage the team.
The duo quickly caused the team damage, with Pinto da Costa as football director and Pedroto as manager, winning two titles previously, and making controversial remarks about the centralization of Portuguese football, which caused them problems with the directing board, and consequently they left.
After quitting, in 1982 Pinto da Costa ran for presidency and won bringing back Pedroto.
The following decades turned what was the third team in the overall history of Portuguese football into the biggest title winner of the past 20 years.
Since 1982, Porto has won 16 titles, achieving the record Penta (five leagues in a row) in 1999 and since 1976 never finished below 3rd place, ten Portuguese cups, and has a majority of Supercups, having won 15 out of a possible 30.

International titles
1987 - European Champions Cup
When Pinto da Costa joined as president, Porto was the only club from the "big three" without European honours, but that quickly changed.
The first final was played against Juventus F.C.
for the 1984 Cup Winners' Cup, but Porto lost.
Three years later, the team led by Artur Jorge, the name hand-picked by Pedroto, won its first European honour, in a thrilling 2–1 victory over Bayern Munich in the European Cup 1986–87.
The following year Porto won the European Super Cup, against Ajax Amsterdam, and the Intercontinental Cup, against Peñarol, making them the first Portuguese winners of the two cups.
1988–2002
The following 16 years saw Porto as a midrange team - often in the final 16, but not progressing much further.
The exception was in 1994, when Porto reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Champions League.
The semi-final, decided on a single game, resulted in a heavy loss (3–0) at the hands of Johann Cruyff's FC Barcelona, in the Nou Camp.
2003 - UEFA Cup
In 2003, under the guidance of José Mourinho, Porto made a thrilling UEFA Cup run, topped with a victory in a fantastic final against Celtic in Seville.
2004 - Champions League
The following season set a greater challenge, but despite a slow start which included a 1–3 loss against Real Madrid, Porto never lost again in the Champions League, relegating Olympique Marseille to the UEFA Cup (where they reached the final), drawing with Manchester United at Old Trafford in the dying minutes of play to go through on aggregate, Olympique Lyon and Deportivo.
Porto beat Monaco 3–0 in the Final played in Arena AufSchalke.
Porto's UEFA Champions League winning line-up: Vitor Baia, Nuno Valente, Ricardo Carvalho, Jorge Costa(c), Paulo Ferreira, Costinha, Nuno Maniche, Pedro Mendes, Deco (Pedro Emanuel), Derlei (Benni McCarthy), Carlos Alberto Gomes (Dmitri Alenichev)
After the victory, Porto became the Portuguese side with the most European cups won - 2 CL/ECC, UEFA Super Cup plus a UEFA Cup, compared with the two ECC by Benfica and the one CWC by Sporting.
Even after the departure of José Mourinho to Chelsea FC, the club kept winning at the international level.
On December 12 2004, FC Porto won the last-held Intercontinental Cup, by beating Once Caldas from Colombia 8–7 in a penalty shoot-out, after a goalless draw.
Stadium
Porto's home games are played at Estádio do Dragão ( ) in Porto.
Built as a replacement for Porto's old ground, Estadio das Antas, and as a venue for EURO 2004, Estádio do Dragão has an all-seated capacity of 50,948.
The stadium's name is derived from the presence of a dragon on the crest of Porto, which is also the nickname of Porto fans.
Designed by Manuel Salgado and built by the Grupo Amorim, it cost €97.755.318, of which €18.430.956 was supported by the Portuguese taxpayers.
To support costs, each stand carries one or two sponsor names, edp for the South (Sul) end, tmn and Sapo adsl in the East (Nascente) stand, PT and meo for the West (Poente) stand and finally Coca-Cola in the North (Norte) Stand.
Away fans are placed in the left corner of the North stand, while Porto supporter groups (SuperDragões and Colectivo Ultras 95) are at each end, although initially both groups were in the South stand.
