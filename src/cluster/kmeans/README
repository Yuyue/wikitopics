Overview
========

These projects are for running Mallet for clustering articles.

The projects are mistitled in my current opinion
because the title does not reflect what they do well.
What they do:
	ClusterFiles: cluster documents each of which is stored in a separate text file using K-means.
	ClusterRow: cluster documents the list of which is stored in a CSV file that
		contains the reponses of MTurkers about the relevance of the documents.
