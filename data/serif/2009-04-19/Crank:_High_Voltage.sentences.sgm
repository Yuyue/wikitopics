Crank: High Voltage is the 2009 sequel to the 2006 action film, Crank.
It picks up 3 months after the first film left off, retaining its "real-time" feel and adding surrealism.
Crank: High Voltage was written and directed by Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor, who both wrote and directed the previous film, Crank.
The film was released in the United Kingdom on April 16, 2009, one day prior to its North American release date.
Plot
Chev Chelios (Jason Statham), has survived the fall from a helicopter that occurred at the end of the first movie.
Immediately after his fall, he is abducted off the ground by a group of Chinese medics, who take to farm his organs.
However, Chev wakes up mid-surgery and sees them take out his heart and replace it with a mechanical one.
He then wakes up and kills the operators, but must chase after his heart which has been stolen.
He then runs into his old girlfriend Eve Lydon (Amy Smart) who believed him to be dead.

Production
Mike Patton, of Faith No More and Mr. Bungle fame, produced the score for Crank 2: High Voltage.
Lionsgate Films will handle North American distribution of the film, while Lakeshore Entertainment will handle international distribution.
Filming started in April 2008.
The writers and directors confirmed there will be more sex and violence within an R rating.
Like the first film, the production budget will be lower than $20 million.
In order to help keep costs low, the filmmakers have taken advantage of low cost prosumer HDV cameras such as the Canon XH-A1, as well as a consumer model, the Canon HF10.
The movie has received an R rating by the MPAA based on an interview with Amy Smart.
She was photographed brandishing taped nipples and disclosed that her character Eve has become a pole dancer.
She also said that there will be another public sex scene with Jason Statham, this time taking place on a horse racing track.
Soundtrack
Linkin Park's song, "Given Up", was featured in the trailer for the movie, but not in the movie itself (lead singer Chester Bennington has a cameo in both films).
The majority of the soundtrack will be done by Mike Patton.
Reception
Critical response has been mixed, with Rotten Tomatoes aggregating a 68% Fresh rating based on 38 reviews, and an average score of 62 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on 7 reviews.
