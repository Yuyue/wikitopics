The Cleveland Show is an American animated series which premiered on September 27, 2009 as a part of the "Animation Domination" lineup on Fox.
The series was created by Seth MacFarlane, Mike Henry, and Richard Appel as a spin-off from Family Guy, which was also created by MacFarlane.
Background
In the beginning of the series, Cleveland Brown and his son, Cleveland Jr., move from Rhode Island to the fictional town of Stoolbend, Virginia.
In the closing scene of the season seven Family Guy episode "Baby Not on Board", Cleveland breaks the fourth wall by mentioning to Quagmire that he is getting a spin-off.
The theme song originally contained a line referring to Cleveland's "happy black-guy face," but this was replaced with "happy mustached face" to make the song more racially sensitive.
Characters
Family
His newly introduced family includes his new wife in her late thirties, Donna Tubbs (Sanaa Lathan); Donna's teenage daughter, Roberta Tubbs (Nia Long);) and Donna's five year-old son, Rallo Tubbs (Mike Henry).
Cleveland Jr., who also appears in the show, is now fourteen and is more obese than in his previous appearances on Family Guy, and is now voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson.
Neighbors
Cleveland's neighbors also include a family of anthropomorphic bears (the husband, Tim, voiced by MacFarlane, and the wife, Arianna, voiced by Arianna Huffington), a "hipster" wannabe named Holt (voiced by Jason Sudeikis), a redneck couple (the husband Lester voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson) and a Victorian Rhodes family, with the husband to be voiced by Seth MacFarlane.
Guests
There will also be an episode in 2010 which features rapper Kanye West playing a character named Kenny West.
The producers stated working with West was a very good experience and a reason they chose him was that they knew he was a fan of Family Guy.
Main cast
Debut
Cleveland officially left Family Guy, but MacFarlane has hinted that he may come back for occasional visits if necessary, and has also hinted Family Guy characters will visit Cleveland in Virginia.
The show, which was scheduled to debut in the beginning of 2009, premiered on September 27, 2009.
Due to the cancellation of Mike Judge's King of the Hill, the American adaptation of Sit Down, Shut Up being moved to Saturday nights, and the renewal of American Dad!, The Simpsons is now the only cartoon on Fox's "Animation Domination" line-up that was not created by Seth MacFarlane.
While both Family Guy and American Dad!
air in the UK on BBC Three, The Cleveland Show will instead air on E4 in December 2009.
Episodes
The show, which was picked up to air a first season consisting of 22 episodes, was picked up by Fox for a second season, consisting of 13 episodes, bringing the total number to 35 episodes.
The announcement was made on May 3, 2009 before the first season even premiered.
