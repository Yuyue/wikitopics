Errors in stats
---------------
There are some files that are seemingly cut in the middle of file transfer.
However, those files are the same as the original stats that Frédéric Schütz and Tomas Mituzas have.
These files are located in the separate directory (data/wikistats/archive/errors) to facilitate script running; The bad stats tend to crash scripts!

Some basic stuff about the data:
--------------------------------

The data are in very trivial format, which is projectname, pagename, pageviews, and bytes (of the article).

If there are two hourly statistics for the same hour, only 1 minute apart:
they are duplicates.

2009/05/pagecounts-20090511-070001.gz 2009/05/pagecounts-20090511-070000.gz are almost the same, but still different

Redundant files:
gunzip -c 2009/05/pagecounts-20090512-000000.gz > fred
gunzip -c 2009/05/pagecounts-20090512-010000.gz > foo
gunzip -c 2009/05/pagecounts-20090512-010001.gz > bar
gunzip -c 2009/05/pagecounts-20090512-020000.gz > baz
diff foo bar > qux
Turned out foo has a field that does not appear in fred bar and baz, which supports bar missing somethings.
Turned out foo and bar mostly overlap, which means one of them should be discarded.
Turned out foo's field has the page view equal to or greater than that of bar's field.
