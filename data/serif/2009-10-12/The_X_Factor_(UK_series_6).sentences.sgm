The sixth series of British television music talent show The X Factor began airing on ITV on 22 August 2009.
It is presented by Dermot O'Leary.
Public auditions by aspiring pop singers began in June 2009 and were held in five major cities across the United Kingdom.
Simon Cowell, Dannii Minogue, Louis Walsh, and Cheryl Cole returned to judge the contestants, with auditions being held in front of a live audience for the first time.
Following initial auditions, the "Bootcamp" stage took place in August 2009, where the number of contestants was narrowed down to 24.
The 24 contestants were split into their categories, Boys, Girls, Over 25s and Groups and given a judge to mentor them at the "Judges' Houses" stage and throughout the finals.
During "Judges' Houses", the 24 acts were reduced to 12, who will go on to the live finals, with one act being eliminated each week by a public vote until a winner is found.
The live shows started on 10 October 2009.
The acts perform every Saturday night with the results announced on Sundays.
Judges and presenters
All four series 5 judges – Simon Cowell, Dannii Minogue, Louis Walsh and Cheryl Cole – have returned for this series.
Dermot O'Leary again presents the main ITV1 programme with Holly Willoughby hosting spin-off show The Xtra Factor on ITV2, returning to work just over a month after giving birth to her first child.
Sponsors
This series of The X Factor is sponsored by TalkTalk and features break bumpers pioneered by CHI & Partners, showing light graffiti set against night-time backdrops across Britain.
Part of the deal, which applies to ITV1, ITV2 and the programme's website, sees TalkTalk customers having the chance to design the break bumpers and download exclusive content.
Selection process
Auditions were held during June and July 2009 across five cities: London (Excel Centre), Manchester (Manchester Central), Birmingham (ICC), Cardiff (International Arena) and Glasgow (Braehead Arena).
In a change to previous series, auditions were held in front of a live audience due to the success of a similar system on Britain's Got Talent.
However, Glaswegian auditionees had already been judged using the old format, meaning that they had to apply again, as their initial audition was void.
As with the auditions, the "Boot Camp" selection stage was filmed with a live audience.
Filming took place on 1 August at the Hammersmith Apollo.
Approximately 200 acts attended Boot Camp.
They were initially split into groups of three, and judges gave instant decisions on who would leave based on the group performances, bringing the number of acts down to 100.
The judges cut the number of acts down to 50.
Following a further set of auditions, the number of contestants was narrowed to 24.
Originally, the group Trucolorz were chosen by the judges for the final 24 but were disqualified due to one of the group's members being too young for the show, and they were replaced by Harmony Hood.
The contestants were then split into the usual four categories before the judges discovered which category they would mentor for the rest of the competition.
The Boys (16–24) are being mentored by Cole, Minogue has the Girls (16–24), Cowell is mentoring the Over 25s, and Walsh takes charge of the Groups.
Each judge had help from a guest judge during the "Judges' Houses" stage.
Will Young assisted Cole in Marrakech, Morocco, Minogue had help from her sister Kylie Minogue in Atlantis, The Palm, Dubai, Boyzone singer Ronan Keating helped Walsh near Lake Como in Italy, and Cowell had help from Sinitta in Los Angeles.
At Judges' Houses, each act sang for their respective judge, and each judge and their guest eliminated three acts, leaving 12 acts to perform in the live shows.
The eliminated acts were:
Boys: Ethan Boroian, Daniel Fox, Duane Lamonte
Girls: Nicole Jackson, Stacey McClean, Despina Pilavakis
Over 25s: Treyc Cohen,  Nicole Lawrence, Daniel Pearce
Groups: De-Tour, Harmony Hood, Project A

Controversy and criticism
Treatment of contestants
On 2 August 2009, The People reported that some Boot Camp contestants felt they had been poorly treated by the show's producers; one compared the experience with that of a concentration camp and another claimed that those competing were only allowed to use the toilet twice a day.
However, a spokesperson for the programme refuted the claims, saying "Yes, it was long hours but they knew what they were signing up for.
The hopefuls got breakfast at the hotel and decent food throughout the day".
Contestants
The show was criticised in September 2009 for "recycling" contestants, as three singers from the final 24 acts had already been in pop bands, two had auditioned for The X Factor in previous years and one had appeared on Britain's Got Talent.
Judges
Controversy began after the first live show on 10 October, after judge Dannii Minogue commented on press reports regarding Danyl Johnson's sexuality, sparking an online backlash.
Minogue's comments received some media coverage resulting in Minogue releasing a statement on the issue:
"I want to clear up exactly what happened on last night's X Factor show and post my sincere apologies to anyone who took offense.
I made a comment about Danyl changing the lyrics of his song.
It was meant to be a humorous moment about the fact he has an opportunity to have fun with his song.
An openly bi-sexual singing a song that is lyrically a 'girl's song'.
Danyl and I were joking about the very same thing in rehearsals on Friday, so it carried on to the show.
I'd like to apologise to anyone that was offended by my comments, it was never my intention.
I spoke to Danyl straight after the show last night and he wasn't offended or upset by my comments, and knew exactly what I was saying".
Minogue also apologised on the live results show on 11th October 2009, saying Danyl was not upset by her comments.
