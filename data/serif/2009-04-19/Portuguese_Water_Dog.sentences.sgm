The Portuguese Water Dog, colloquially known as a Portie or PWD, is a working or utility dog that does best when he has a job to do.
Portuguese Water Dogs once existed all along Portugal's coast, where they were taught to herd fish into fishermen's nets, to retrieve lost tackle or broken nets, and to act as couriers from ship to ship, or ship to shore.
Portuguese Water Dogs rode in bobbing fishing trawlers as they worked their way from the cold Atlantic waters of Portugal to the frigid fishing waters off the coast of Iceland where the fleets caught cod to bring home.
In Portugal, the breed is called Cão d'Água (pronounced Kown-d'Ahgwa; literally "water dog").
In its native land, the dog is also known as the Portuguese Fishing Dog (Cão Pescador Português).
Cão de Água de Pêlo Ondulado is the name given the wavy-haired variety, and Cão de Água de Pêlo Encaracolado is the name for the curly-coated variety.
The Portuguese Water Dog is a fairly rare breed; only 15 entrants for Portuguese Water Dogs were made to England's Crufts competition in 2002.
Though some breeders claim they are a hypoallergenic dog breed, there is no scientific evidence to support this claim.
However, their non-shedding qualities have made them more popular in recent years.
Description
Appearance
The closest relatives of the PWD are widely thought to be the Barbet and Standard Poodle.
Like Poodles and several other water dog breeds, PWDs are highly intelligent, can have curly coats, have webbed toes for swimming, and do not shed.
However, Portuguese Water Dogs are more robustly built, with stout legs, and can have a wavy coat instead of tightly curled.
Also, fanciers generally do not dock their tails, whereas Poodle tails are customarily docked.
Portuguese Water Dog eyes are consistently brown, and their coats can be black, brown, black and white or brown and white.
Many brown dogs fade in shade as they age.
There are very rare instances of white dogs without brown or black.
Male Portuguese Water Dogs usually grow to be about 20 to 23 inches (51 cm to 58 cm) tall, and they weigh between 40 and 60 pounds (18 kg to 27 kg), while the females usually grow to be about 17 to 21 inches (43 cm to 53 cm) tall, and they weigh between 35 and 50 pounds.
PWDs have a single-layered coat that does not shed (see Moult), and therefore their presence is tolerated extremely well among many people who suffer from dog allergies.
Some call PWDs hypoallergenic dogs, but any person with dog allergies who seeks a dog with these qualities should actually spend time with the animals before purchasing, to test whether the dog is truly non-allergenic to them.
Most PWDs, especially those shown in conformation shows, are entirely black, black and white, brown, or silver-tipped; it is common to see white chest spots and white paws or legs on black or brown coated dogs.
"Parti" or "Irish-marked" coats, with irregular white and black spots, are rare but visually striking.
"Parti" dogs are becoming more common in the United States.
However, in Portugal the breed standard does not allow more than 30% white markings.
Overall, white is the least common Portuguese Water Dog color, while black with white markings on the chin ("milk chin") and chest is the most common color combination.
The black portions of Portuguese Water Dogs have a bluish tinge to their skin that may be hard to notice underneath their black hair.
Predominantly white areas have pink skin underneath and are more sensitive to exposure to the sun than black or brown areas.
White hair is finer than black.
Depending on their genetic heritage, many brown PWDS, as well as a few lineages of black ones,  gradually turn gray over their entire bodies as they age, with the possible exception of their ears and paws.
Once begun, this color change, which is sometimes called "blueing", continues throughout the dog's life; it is caused by the growth of white hairs among the colored ones, much like the greying of a human being's head or beard hair.
Coat types
This breed does not shed its hair.
The hair is either wavy or curly.
Many dogs have mixed pattern hair: curly all over the body but wavy on the tail and ears.
From the Portuguese Water Dog Club of America Revised Standard for the Portuguese Water Dog come these descriptions of the two coat types:
Curly coat: "Compact, cylindrical curls, somewhat lusterless.
The hair on the ears is sometimes wavy".
Wavy coat: "Falling gently in waves, not curls, and with a slight sheen".
If left untended, the hair on a PWD will keep growing indefinitely.
Problems associated with this include the hair around the eyes growing so long as to impede vision, and matting of the body hair, which can cause skin irritations.
For these reasons, PWDs must be trimmed about every two months.
Although it is possible to groom them at home, many owners find it easier to pay a professional groomer and, to avoid matting, they brush out the coat regularly between groomings.
Improper coat
Occasionally, a dog may have what is termed an "improper" coat.
This genetic condition causes the dog to have an undercoat.
Because improperly coated PWDs do not adhere to the breed standard, they may not be shown in conformation competition.
Otherwise they are completely healthy and have all the excellent traits of the breed.
They should not be used in breeding programs, because improper coat is an inherited condition.
Grooming styles
The hair of PWDs grows continually and requires regular brushing and cutting or clipping.
The coat is usually worn in a "retriever cut" or a "lion cut".
The lion cut
In the lion cut, the hindquarters, muzzle, and the base of the tail are shaved and the rest of the body is left full length.
This cut originated with the fishing dogs of Portugal.
This is the traditional cut and perhaps the most functional, given the breed's main historical significance as a fisherman's companion.
The lion cut diminished the initial impact and shock of cold water when the breed jumped from the boats, as well as providing warmth to the vitals.
The hindquarters were left shaved to allow easier movement of the back legs and the breed's powerful, rudder-like tail.
The retriever cut
The retriever cut is left 1" (2.5 cm) long evenly over the body (although some owners prefer the muzzle or the base of the tail shorter).
This cut is a more recent style and originated because breeders wanted to make the breed more appealing and less unusual looking for buyers.
Sometimes owners will clip the hair of their dogs very short, especially in the summer months, in modified retriever cut.
Vocalization
Portuguese Water Dogs have a multi-octave voice.
They tend to be quiet dogs although they will warn when the home is approached, and they will communicate their desires vocally and behaviorally to their owner.
Their bark is loud and distinctive.
They may engage in "expressive panting", by making a distinct "ha-ha-ha-ha" sound as an invitation to play or to indicate a desire for nearby food.
They sometimes whine.
The PWD's biddability, high intelligence, and tendency to vocalize and then seek out its human master when specific alarms occur make it an ideal hearing-ear or deaf-assistance dog.
PWDs can be readily trained to bark loudly when a telephone rings, and then to find and alert a hard-of-hearing or deaf master.
Temperament
Portuguese Water dogs make excellent companions.
They are loving, independent, and intelligent and are easily trained in obedience and agility skills.
Once introduced, they are generally friendly to strangers, and actively enjoy being petted, which, due to their soft, fluffy coats, is a favour that human beings willingly grant them.
Because they are working dogs, PWDs are generally content in being at their master's side, awaiting directions, and, if they are trained, they are willing and able to follow complex commands.
They learn very quickly, seem to enjoy the training process, and have a long memory for the names of objects.
They are generally considered too small to be used as service dogs or guide dogs for the blind, but they make unusually good therapy dogs and hearing dogs (assistance dogs for the deaf).
Owners of this breed will attest that their PWD usually stays in proximity to them both indoors and outdoors.
This is typical of the breed.
Though very gregarious animals, these dogs will typically bond with one primary or alpha family member.
Some speculate that this intense bonding arose in the breed because the dogs were selected to work in proximity to their masters on small fishing boats, unlike other working dogs such as herding dogs and water dogs that range out to perform tasks.
In any case, the modern PWD, whether employed on a boat or kept as a pet or a working therapy dog, loves water, attention and prefers to be engaged in activity within sight of a human partner.
This is not a breed to be left alone for long periods of time, indoors or out.
As water dogs, the PWD's retrieving instinct is strong, which also gives some dogs tugging and chewing tendencies.
A PWD will commonly jump as a greeting.
Owners may choose to limit this behavior.
Some PWDs may walk, hop, or "dance" on their hind legs when greeting or otherwise enthusiastic.
Some PWDs will stand upright at kitchen counters and tables, especially if they smell food above them.
This habit is known as "counter surfing" and is characteristic of the breed.
Although it can be a nuisance, many PWD owners evidently enjoy seeing their dogs walking, hopping, standing up, or "countering" and do not seriously discourage these activities.
While excellent companions to those who understand their needs, Portuguese Water Dogs are not for everyone.
Their intelligence and working drive demand consistent attention in the form of regular vigorous exercise and mental challenges.
Gentle and patient, they look (and are) soft, cuddly, and cute — but they are not to be mistaken for "couch potatoes".
When bored, PWDs will become destructive.
A PWD can get into the garbage, silently snag food off the kitchen counters when its owner's back is turned, and can even learn to open cabinet doors.
History
The PWD in ancient times
Some believe that the breed may be traced as far back as 700 B.C.
to the wild Central-Asian steppes near the Chinese–Russian border in terrain and waters guaranteed to nourish ruggedness.
The early people who lived there raised cattle, sheep, camels, or horses.
They also raised dogs to herd them.
Isolated from the rest of the world, these dogs developed into a definite type, very much like the heavier long-coated Portuguese water dog.
One theory of these long-perished times is that some of the rugged Asian herding dogs were captured by the Berbers, a people who spread slowly across the face of North Africa to Morocco.
Their descendants, the Moors, arrived in Portugal in the 8th century, bringing the water dogs with them.
Another theory purports that some of the dogs left the Asian steppes with the Goths, a confederation of German tribes.
Some, (the Ostrogoths), went west and their dogs became the German poodle, called in German the poodle-hund or puddle-dog, that is, water-dog.
Others, (the Visigoths), went south to fight the Romans, and their dogs became the Lion Dog, groomed in the traditional lion cut.
In 400 CE, the Visigoths invaded Iberia (modern Spain and Portugal, then known as Hispania) and the dogs found their homeland.
A Portuguese Water Dog is first described in 1297 in a monk’s account of a drowning sailor who was pulled from the sea by a dog with a "black coat, the hair long and rough, cut to the first rib and with a tail tuft".
"History of the Portuguese Water Dog", Kathryn Braund and Deyanne Farrell Miller, The Complete Portuguese Water Dog, 1986, webpage:  DeLeao.
These theories explain how the Poodle and the Portuguese Water Dog may have developed from the same ancient genetic pool.
At one time the Poodle was a longer-coated dog, as is one variety of the Portuguese Water Dog.
The possibility also exists that some of the long-coated water dogs grew up with the ancient Iberians.
In early times, Celtiberians migrated from lands which now belong to southwestern Germany.
Swarming over the Pyrenees, circulating over the whole of western Europe, they established bases in Iberia, as well as in Ireland, Wales, and Brittany.
The Irish Water Spaniel and Kerry Blue Terrier are believed by some to be descendants of the Portuguese Water Dog.
The modern PWD
The PWD was a breed on the verge of extinction when, during the 1930s, Vasco Bensaude, a wealthy Portuguese shipping magnate, began to seek out fishermen's dogs and utilize them in a breeding program to re-establish the breed.
Bensaude's kennel was named Algarbiorum, and his most famous dog was Leão (1931-1942), a very "type-y" fisherman's stud dog who was bred to so many different females that about half of the pedigreed Portuguese Water Dogs in existence can trace their lineage back to him.
Bensaude was aided by two Portuguese veterinarians, Dr. Francisco Pinto Soares and Dr. Manuel Fernandes Marques.
His work was carried on by Conchita Cintron de Castelo Branco, to whom he gave his last 17 PWDs and all his archives.
Dr. António Cabral was the founder of the Avalade kennels in Portugal.
Ch.
Charlie de Avalade (Charlie), a brown-coated dog, and C. B. Baluarte de Avalade (Balu) were two of his many famous PWDs.
He registered his first PWD in 1954, after Bensaude had pioneered the re-establishment of the breed in Portugal.
Cabral worked with Carla Molinari, Deyanne Miller, Sonja Santos and others to establish PWDs in the US.
The "Mark of Cabral" is a triangular shape of different color/textured hair, usually a few inches from the base of the tail.
You can see it more easily on a fresh lion clip -- it can look like the clipper got too close.
Deyanne Miller is the single person most responsible for the rise of the PWD in America.
In 1972, the Millers, along with 14 other people, formed the Portuguese Water Dog Club of America, Inc. (PWDCA).
She worked with dogs from both the Cintron and Cabral lineages to establish a stable genetic pool of PWDs in the United States at her Farmion kennels.
Another early US breeder of PWDs was the actor Raymond Burr.
Genetic diseases
As with all purebred dogs, PWDs are vulnerable to certain genetic defects.
Due to the limited gene pool for this breed, conscientious breeders carefully study pedigrees and select dogs to minimize the chance of genetic disease and improper coat.
Unfortunately, like many breeds, a growing popularity has encouraged breeding by people who are not knowledgeable about the breed.
Hip dysplasia
Like poodles, PWDs are vulnerable to hip dysplasia.
However, the risk of a PWD developing hip dysplasia can be greatly reduced by thoroughly checking the pedigrees and health clearances in both the sire and dam of your dog.
Hip dysplasia is a congenital and developmental problem with the hip joints.
Cataracts, PRA, and distichiasis
Cataracts and PRA (Progressive Retinal Atrophy) are two eye diseases found in PWDs.
As with hip dysplasia, some lines carry these defects more frequently than others.
PRA, which causes "night blindness", may lead to complete blindness.
Fortunately this is a simple recessive gene.
DNA testing is now available which can identify a dog carrying the gene for PRA.
Known as "Optigen Testing" a "normal" or "A" dog does not carry the gene for PRA.
A "carrier" or "B" dog carries one copy of the PRA gene and the dog will NOT express the disease but may or may not pass the gene to offspring.
An "affected" or "C" dog has two copies of the PRA version of the gene and will probably express the disease as late onset Progressive Retinal Atrophy.
A "B" or "C" dog should be bred only to an "A" dog to ensure that any offspring will not express the disease.
Ingrown eyelashes (distichiasis) is not uncommon in PWDs and other curly-coated breeds, due to their curly hair.
Ingrown eyelashes will rub the eye causing extensive corneal ulcerations.
The condition is minor so long as it is not ignored, and can be surgically treated if necessary.
GM1 Storage Disease
GM1 Storage Disease, one of a family of conditions called GM1 gangliosidoses, is a recessive, genetic disorder that is inevitably fatal.
It is caused by a deficiency of beta-galactosidase, with resulting abnormal storage of acidic lipid materials in cells of the central and peripheral nervous systems, but particularly in the nerve cells.
Because PWDs are all rather closely related to one another and share a limited gene pool, PWDs who were GM1 Storage Disease carriers were able to be genetically identified, and the condition has now been almost entirely eliminated from the breed.
All breeding stock should be tested for GM-1 storage disease or GM1 gangliosidoses, which is a fatal nerve disease that typically appears when a puppy is approximately six months of age.
The affected puppy will show clinical signs of cerebellar dysfunction including ataxia, tremors, paresis, and seizures.
The pet may also exhibit a change in temperament.
Lesions of the retina and clouding of the cornea may occur.
GM-1 storage disease is a recessive deficiency of betagalactosidase.
The condition has been genetically identified and is no longer common.
Juvenile Dilated Cardiomyopathy
Juvenile Dilated Cardiomyopathy is a rare, fatal condition caused by an autosomal recessive gene.
It affects young dogs, who succumb to heart failure before reaching adulthood.
As a simple recessive gene, it had been difficult to identify and was particularly heartbreaking as seemingly healthy puppies would suddenly die, often shortly after joining their adopted families.
Since a recessive gene is responsible, that means if at least one parent is "normal" (that is, it does not carry a copy of the cardio version of the gene), its offspring can not contract the disease.
In 2007 a genetic linkage test became available which appears promising.
This is not a test which confirms if a dog has, or doesn't have the disease; nor will it definitively predict the disease, as even if a dog is a JDC carrier this does not gaurantee its offspring will suffer the disease.
It only links certain strains of DNA as carriers of JDC.
This is  significant in that these strains can now largely be deselected for in the breeding process, as has been successful with GM1 Storage Disease (see above).
The test is not yet complete for every bloodline, and why the identified strains are implicated is still unknown, and so in essence the cause of the condition remains a mystery to be solved.
Notable Portuguese Water Dogs
U.S.
Senator Ted Kennedy is the owner of three Portuguese Water Dogs: Splash, Sunny, and Cappy.
Splash serves as the fictional narrator in Kennedy's children's book called My Senator and Me: A Dog's-Eye View of Washington, D.C..
BARK team members feature Portuguese Water Dogs who retrieve home run balls that land in McCovey Cove, the body of water adjacent to AT&T Park.
During every Sunday San Francisco Giants home game, these talented canines will work from boats and dive after splash hit baseballs that land in the water during batting practice and the game.
It was revealed on April 11, 2009 that the First Puppy, the dog given to U.S. President Barack Obama's two daughters Sasha and Malia by Senator Ted Kennedy, was a Portuguese Water Dog.
The girls have named the dog Bo because they have cousins with a cat of the same name and because Mrs. Obama’s father was nicknamed Diddley, after the late musician Bo Diddley.
Obama chose the breed because it is hypoallergenic and Malia has allergies, although it is debated whether or not a dog breed can actually be hypoallergenic.
