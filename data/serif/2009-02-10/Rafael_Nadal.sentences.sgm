Rafael Nadal Parera ( ) (born June 3, 1986) is a Spanish professional tennis player who has been ranked World No.
1 since August 18, 2008.
He has won six Grand Slam singles titles and the 2008 Olympic gold medal in singles.
He has captured the last four French Open singles titles, joining Björn Borg in 2008 as the only man to have won four consecutive singles titles there.
In 2008, Nadal became the second Spanish man to win Wimbledon.
Nadal is the only player in the open era to have won the French Open, the London Queen's club, and Wimbledon in the same year.
In 2009, Nadal became the first Spaniard to win the Australian Open, the fourth male tennis player—behind Jimmy Connors, Mats Wilander and Andre Agassi—to win Grand Slam titles on three different surfaces, and the first male tennis player to hold Grand Slam singles titles on three different surfaces simultaneously (2008 French Open, 2008 Wimbledon Championships, and 2009 Australian Open).
For much of his career, Nadal has had a rivalry with Roger Federer, which many consider to be among the greatest in tennis history.
They are the only men in the open era who have played each other in seven Grand Slam finals, with Nadal winning five of those matches.
Nadal was ranked World No.
2 behind Federer for a record 160 weeks before earning the top spot.
Nadal has won 13 of their 19 singles matches to date, as well as all five of their most recent encounters.
Nadal has been especially successful on clay courts.
He has a 22–1 record in clay court tournament finals and is undefeated in 43 best-of-five-set matches on clay.
In each of the last four years, he has won both the French Open and two clay court Masters Series tournaments.
He also owns the longest single-surface winning streak in the open era, having won 81 consecutive matches on clay from April 2005 to May 2007.
As a result, some tennis critics and top players already regard him as the greatest clay-court player of all time.
On October 18, 2008, Nadal clinched the year-end World No.
1 ranking for 2008.
The same year, he was given the prestigious Prince of Asturias Award for his achievements in sports.
Family and early life
Rafael Nadal was born in Manacor, Majorca to Sebastián Nadal and Ana María Parera.
He has a younger sister named María Isabel.
His uncle, Miguel Ángel Nadal, is a retired professional football player, having played for RCD Mallorca, FC Barcelona, and the Spanish national team.
Nadal supports football clubs Real Madrid and RCD Mallorca.
His other uncle, Toni Nadal, a former professional tennis player, introduced him to tennis when he was three years old.
Toni Nadal has been coaching him ever since.
Toni spotted that Nadal had a natural talent for tennis, and at eight he won an under-12 year regional tennis championship at a time where he was also a promising football player.
This made Toni Nadal intensify training, and at that time he encouraged Nadal to play left-handed, as he noticed Nadal played forehand shots with two hands.
The natural right-handed Nadal took the advice.
When Nadal was 12, he won the Spanish and European tennis titles in his age group and was playing tennis and football all the time.
Nadal's father made him choose between football and tennis so that his school work would not suffer.
Nadal said: "I chose tennis.
Football had to stop straight away".
When he was 14, the Spanish tennis federation requested that he leave Mallorca and move to Barcelona to continue his tennis progression and training.
Nadal's family turned down this request, partly because they feared it would hurt his education, but also because Toni Nadal said that "I don't want to believe that you have to go to America, or other places to be a good athlete.
You can do it from your house".
The decision to stay home meant that Nadal received less financial support from the federation; instead Nadal's father covered the costs.
In May 2001, he defeated former Grand Slam champion Pat Cash in a clay-court exhibition match.
By the age of 16, Nadal was ranked in the world's top 50 players.

Playing style
Nadal generally plays an aggressive behind-the-baseline game founded on heavy topspin groundstrokes, consistency, speedy footwork, and tenacious court coverage.
Known for his athleticism and speed around the court, Nadal is a capable defender who hits well on the run, constructing winning plays from seemingly defensive positions.
While primarily a baseliner, Nadal is also a comfortable net player, using well-struck approach shots, drop shots, and volleys when situations dictate.
Nadal's touch and skill at net and his ability to finish points from that position on the court are one of the most underestimated aspects of his game.
Nadal plays left-handed despite being naturally right-handed, and uses his dominant right hand as an anchor for his double-handed backhand.
Although right-handed, Nadal claims he is left-footed and that it is difficult for him to play with his right hand.
Nadal employs a full western grip forehand, often with a "buggy-whip" follow through, where his left arm hits through the ball and finishes above his left shoulder—as opposed to a more traditional finish across the body or around his opposite shoulder.
Nadal's forehand groundstroke form allows him to hit shots with heavy topspin—more so than many of his contemporaries.
While Nadal's shots tend to land short of the baseline, the characteristically high bounces his forehands achieve tend to mitigate the advantage an opponent would normally gain from capitalizing on a short ball.
Nadal is also able to hit his forehand with a more traditional follow-through when a deeper, more penetrating shot is called for.
Nadal has developed his serve into a solid weapon since his earlier years as a pro.
Nadal is able to deliver a high percentage of first serves, struck with pace and placed strategically.
Nadal's second serve usually employs a hard left-handed slice towards right-handed opponents' backhands.
Nadal relies on the consistency of his serve to gain a strategic advantage early in the point and earn a respectable amount of aces and service winners.
Nadal's mental resiliency and strategic approach to the game is another noted strength.
Nadal is able to avoid discouragement regardless of match score, allowing him to singularly focus on winning the current point and gaining an advantage.
As a strategic player, Nadal can assess outside variables such as court surface, weather conditions, and his opponent's tactics in order to adjust his own play to best adapt to present conditions.
While Nadal's game is best-suited to clay courts, Nadal is no longer considered a "clay court specialist" due to continued success at tournaments played on other surfaces.
Despite praise for Nadal's talent and skill, some have questioned his longevity in the sport, citing his build and playing style as conducive to injury.
Nadal himself has admitted to the physical toll hard courts place on ATP Tour players, calling for a reevaluated tour schedule featuring less hard court tournaments.
Equipment and endorsements
Nadal uses a discontinued Babolat AeroPro Drive racquet with a 4 1/4" L2 grip.
Nadal's racquets are painted to resemble the Aero Pro Drive with Cortex racquet in order to market a current model which Babolat sells.
Nadal uses no replacement grip, and instead wraps 2 overgrips around the handle.
Nadal uses Duralast 15L strings—strung between 55 and 56 pounds—while promoting Babolat's Pro Hurricane Tour strings for marketing purposes.
Nadal's Babolat tennis bag displays his nickname as well as 4 brown stars symbolizing his 4 victories at the French Open and 1 green star symbolizing his victory at Wimbledon.
Nike serves as Nadal's clothing and shoe sponsor.
Nadal's signature on-court attire entailed a variety of sleeveless shirts paired with 3/4 length capri pants.
For the 2009 season, Nadal has adopted more traditional on-court apparel.
Nike encouraged Nadal to update his look in order to reflect his new status as the sport's top player and associate Nadal with a style that—while less distinctive than his "pirate" look—would be more widely emulated by consumers.
At warmup tournaments in Abu Dhabi and Doha, Nadal played matches in a polo shirt specifically designed for him by Nike, paired with shorts cut above the knee.
Nadal's new, more conventional style carried over to the 2009 Australian Open, where Nadal was outfitted with Nike's Bold Crew Men's Tee and Nadal Long Check Shorts.
Nadal wears Nike's Air Max Breathe Cage II tennis shoes, bearing various customizations throughout the season, including his nickname—"Rafa"—on the right shoe and a stylized bull logo on the left.
Nadal has appeared in advertising campaigns for Kia Motors as a global ambassador for the company.
In May 2008, Kia released a claymation viral ad featuring Nadal in a tennis match with an alien.
Nadal also has an endorsement agreement with Universal DVDs.
