    Things to do until next week:
        Additional Experiments on WikiTopics:
            * Clustering with news articlces.
            * Sentence selection using edit history (manually)

Talked about these things:
    Additional experiments on WikiTopics:
        Website setup for WP current events: can wait
        
        Article selection:
            - use 2010/2011 data
            - make it scalable: mapreduce, randomized algorithms, etc.
            - variation of selection algorithms: which are interesting? Use MTurk to find out. need to define evaulation metrics or criteria
            - automatize it. set up a website.
            - make lists of popular pages across languages available for wikitrans
            - use WP categories: might be good for TT selection
        Clustering:
            - with news articles: definitely a thing to do. use news articles within a window of varying days. Get the news articles from Alex.
            - ensemble clustering
            - similarity thresholds?
            - figure out how to exploit MTurk data for clustering or design a better survey for annotation
            - categorize - what happened in science/politics/etc.
        Sentence Selection
            - edit history: definitely! This is unique to WP that need exploiting.
            - determine p and r using temporal expressions within a window of varying days
            - different summarization: using centroid articles
            - Twitter data: a separate topic.
            - exploit MTurk to get more annotations
    More about WikiTopics:
        Multilingual trending topics across all languages
            - translation/transliteration component
            - make MT better
        Use of WP categories and inter-language links
        CHI paper: demo data
            - drawing a UI: look at other CHI papers
            - user interface: centroid articles and secondary articels (e.g. Justin Bieber's performance in Grammy Awards.)
            - use of WP categories?
    About my thesis.
        One possible topic: how to exploit WP (Chris will be excited about it.) Potential contents are:
            - how WP articles are different from other types of source: changes over time, etc.
            - different uses of WP: topic detection and tracking, machine translation
            - making of something like end of year Google video
            - MT using inter-language links
            - Given a news article, pick WP pages about it.
        The thesis should have 3 or 4 content chapter and transliteration cannot be a chapter (probably.)
    Things I'll do next:
        - improve the current paper doing additional experiments
