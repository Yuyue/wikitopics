Slumdog Millionaire is a 2008 British drama film directed by Danny Boyle, co-directed by Loveleen Tandan, and written by Simon Beaufoy.
It is an adaptation of the Boeke Prize winning and Commonwealth Writers' Prize nominated novel Q and A by Indian author and diplomat Vikas Swarup.
Tandan, who began as the film's casting director, was later appointed the co-director by Boyle because of her significant contributions to the film's production.
Set and filmed in India, Slumdog Millionaire tells the story of a young, uneducated man from the Dharavi slums of Mumbai who appears on an Indian version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?
and exceeds people's expectations, arousing the suspicions of the game show host and of law enforcement officials.
After screenings at the Telluride Film Festival and the Toronto International Film Festival, Slumdog Millionaire initially had a limited North American release on 12 November 2008 to critical acclaim and awards success, and later had a nationwide release in the United States on 26 December 2008 and in the United Kingdom on 9 January 2009.
It premiered in Mumbai on 22 January 2009.
Slumdog Millionaire won five of the six awards it was nominated for at the Critics' Choice Awards and all four of the awards it was nominated for at the Golden Globes, including Best Drama.
It has also been nominated for eleven BAFTA Awards and ten Academy Awards.
Plot
Slumdog Millionaire opens with a police inspector (Irrfan Khan) in Mumbai, India, interrogating and torturing Jamal Malik (Dev Patel, also played by Tanay Chheda and Ayush Mahesh Khedekar), a former street child from the Dharavi slums.
Jamal is a contestant on the game show that is an Indian version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?, hosted by Prem Kumar (noted Bollywood actor Anil Kapoor).
Jamal has made it to the final question, but the police are now accusing him of cheating.
Jamal then begins to offer an explanation of how he knew the answers which is conveyed as a series of flashbacks documenting the particulars of his childhood.
This includes scenes of him obtaining the autograph of Bollywood superstar Amitabh Bachchan; the death of his mother during Hindu-Muslim riots in the slums; and how he and his brother Salim (Madhur Mittal, Azharuddin Mohammed Ismail, and Ashutosh Lobo Gajiwala) befriended the orphan girl, Latika (Freida Pinto, Rubiana Ali, and Tanvi Ganesh Lonkar).
As Jamal's favorite book from his short period in school was The Three Musketeers, he refers to Salim and himself as Athos and Porthos, and Latika as the third Musketeer.
The children are eventually discovered by Maman (Ankur Vikal) while they live in the trash heaps.
Maman is a gangster (a fact they do not actually know at the time they meet him) who "collects" street children so that he can ultimately train them to beg for money.
Salim is groomed to become a part of Maman’s operation and is asked to bring Jamal to Maman in order to be blinded (which would improve his income potential as a singing beggar).
Salim rebels against Maman to protect his brother, and the three children try to escape, but only Salim and Jamal are successful.
Latika is re-captured by Maman's organization and raised as a culturally talented prostitute whose virginity will fetch a high price.
The brothers eke out a living, traveling on top of trains, selling goods, pretending to be tour guides at the Taj Mahal, and pickpocketing.
Jamal eventually insists that they return to Mumbai since he wishes to locate Latika.
When he finds her working as a dancer in a brothel, the brothers attempt to rescue her, but Maman intrudes, and in the resulting conflict Salim draws a gun and kills Maman.
Salim then uses the fact that he killed Maman to obtain a job with Javed (Mahesh Manjrekar), a rival crime lord.
Salim claims Latika as his own and when Jamal protests, Salim threatens to kill him and Latika intervenes, accepting her fate with Salim and breaking Jamal's heart.
Years later, Jamal has a position as a "chai-wallah", (a boy or young man who serves tea) at a call centre.
When he is asked to cover for a co-worker for a couple of minutes, he searches the database for Salim and Latika.
He gets in touch with Salim, who has become a high-ranking lieutenant in Javed’s organization.
Salim invites Jamal to live with him and, after following Salim to Javed's house, he sees Latika living there.
He talks his way in as the new dishwasher and tries to convince Latika to leave.
She rebuffs his advances, but he promises to be at the VT (Victoria Terminal, or Chhatrapati Shivaji) railway station every day at 5pm.
One day Latika attempts to rendezvous with him, but is recaptured by Salim and Javed's men, one of whom slashes her cheek with a knife, scarring her.
Jamal again loses contact with Latika when Javed moves to another home.
In another attempt to find Latika, Jamal tries out for the game show because he knows that she will be watching.
He makes it to the final question, despite the hostile attitude of the host who feeds Jamal an incorrect answer during a break.
At the end of the episode's taping, Jamal has one question left to win 20 million, or two crore, rupees and is taken into police custody, where he is tortured as the police attempt to learn how Jamal, a simple slumdog, could know the answers to so many questions.
After Jamal tells his whole story, explaining how his life experiences coincidentally enabled him to know the answer to each question, the police inspector calls his explanation "bizarrely plausible" and allows Jamal to return to the show for the final question.
At Javed's safehouse, Latika watches the news coverage of Jamal's miraculous run on the show.
Salim gives Latika the keys to his car and his phone and urges her to run away.
When Jamal uses his Phone-A-Friend lifeline to call Salim, Latika answers his phone and they reconnect.
She does not know the answer to the final question either, but believing that "it is written", Jamal guesses the correct answer (Aramis) to the question of the one Musketeer whose name they never learned, and wins the grand prize.
Simultaneously, Salim is discovered to have helped Latika escape and allows himself to be killed in a bathtub full of money after shooting and killing Javed.
Salim's last words are "God is great", which is a Muslim prayer.
Later that night, Jamal and Latika meet at the train station, and finally share a kiss.
The closing credits then imitate a Bollywood-style musical number.
Production
Screenwriter Simon Beaufoy wrote Slumdog Millionaire based on the Boeke Prize winning novel Q and A by Vikas Swarup.
To hone the script, Beaufoy made three research trips to India and interviewed street children, finding himself impressed with their attitudes.
Swarup used many ideas from student director Asim Bhatti while working on the script.
The screenwriter said of his goal for the script: "I wanted to get (across) the sense of this huge amount of fun, laughter, chat, and sense of community that is in these slums.
What you pick up on is this mass of energy".
By the summer of 2006, British production companies Celador Films and Film4 invited director Danny Boyle to read the script Slumdog Millionaire.
Boyle initially hesitated since he was not interested in making a film about Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?
Boyle soon found out that the screenwriter was Beaufoy, who had written The Full Monty (1997), one of the director's favorite British films, and decided to revisit the script.
Boyle was impressed by how Beaufoy wove the multiple storylines from Swarup's book into one narrative, and the director decided to commit to the project.
The film was projected to cost US$15 million, so Celador sought a distributor to share costs.
Fox Searchlight Pictures made an initial offer that was reportedly in the $2 million range, and Warner Independent Pictures made a $5 million offer that Fox Searchlight could not top.
Filmmakers travelled to Mumbai in September 2007 with a partial crew and began hiring local cast and crew for production in Karjat.
Originally beginning as the casting director, Loveleen Tandan, has stated that she "suggested to Danny and Simon Beaufoy, the writer of Slumdog, that it was important to do some of it in Hindi to bring the film alive [...] They asked me to pen the Hindi dialogues which I, of course, instantly agreed to do.
And as we drew closer to the shoot date, Danny asked me to step in as the co-director".
Boyle then decided to translate nearly a third of the film's English dialogue into Hindi.
The director fibbed to Warner Independent's president that he wanted 10% of the dialogue in Hindi, and she approved of the change.
Filming locations included shooting in Mumbai's megaslum and in shantytown parts of Juhu, so filmmakers controlled the crowds by befriending onlookers.
Filming began on 5 November 2007.
In addition to Swarup's original novel Q and A, the film was also directly inspired by Bollywood films.
Tandan has stated that Slumdog Millionaire is a homage to Hindi commercial cinema, noting that "The writer Simon Beaufoy studied Salim-Javed's kind of cinema minutely".
Boyle has cited the influence of the following Bollywood films set in Mumbai: Deewaar (1975) by Yash Chopra, Satya (1998) and Company (2002) by Ram Gopal Verma, and Black Friday (2004) by Anurag Kashyap.
Satya and Company (the latter based on the D-Company) both offered "slick, often mesmerizing portrayals of the Mumbai underworld" and displayed a lot of "brutality and urban violence".
The screenplay for Satya was also co-written by Saurabh Shukla, who portrays Constable Srinivas in Slumdog Millionaire.
Boyle has stated that the chase in one of the opening scenes of Slumdog Millionaire was based on a "12-minute police chase through the crowded Dharavi slum" in Black Friday (itself adapted from S. Hussein Zaidi's book of the same name about the 1993 Bombay bombings).
Deewaar, which Boyle described as being "absolutely key to Indian cinema," is a crime film pitting "a policeman against his brother, a gang leader based on real-life smuggler Haji Mastan," portrayed by Bollywood star Amitabh Bachchan, whose autograph Jamal sought at the beginning of Slumdog Millionaire.
The rags to riches underdog theme underlying the film was also a recurring theme in classic Bollywood movies from the 1950s through to the 1980s, when "India worked to lift itself from hunger and poverty".
Bollywood star Shahrukh Khan, the current host for Kaun Banega Crorepati (the Indian version of Who wants to be a millionaire?
) , was initially offered the role of the show's host in the film, but he eventually turned it down (the role was ultimately played by another Bollywood star Anil Kapoor).
Khan later introduced Slumdog Millionaire during the 66th Golden Globe Awards, where he was presented as the "King of Bollywood".
Paul Smith, the executive producer of Slumdog Millionaire and the chairman of Celador Films, was the original creator of Who Wants to be a Millionaire?
Cast
Dev Patel as Jamal Malik, the protagonist, a Muslim boy born and raised in the poverty of Mumbai.
Boyle considered hundreds of young male actors, although he found that Bollywood leads were generally "strong, handsome hero-types", not the personality he was looking for.
Boyle's 17-year-old daughter pointed him to the British television ensemble drama Skins,  of which Patel was a cast member.
The actor was cast in August 2007.
Ayush Mahesh Khedekar as Youngest Jamal
Tanay Chheda as Middle Jamal
Freida Pinto as Latika, the girl with whom Jamal is in love.
Pinto was an Indian model who had not starred in a feature film before.

Rubiana Ali as Youngest Latika
Tanvi Ganesh Lonkar as Middle Latika
Madhur Mittal as Salim, Jamal's elder brother.

Release
In August 2007 Warner Independent Pictures acquired the American and Pathé the international rights to distribute Slumdog Millionaire theatrically.
Though Warner Independent Pictures paid $5 million to acquire rights to the film, the studio was hesitant about its commercial prospects.
In May 2008, Warner Independent Pictures shut down, initially suggesting that Slumdog Millionaire would go straight to DVD.
In August 2008, the studio began searching for a buyer to relieve its overload of films at the time.
Halfway through the month, Warner Independent Pictures and Fox Searchlight Pictures entered a pact to share distribution of the film with Fox Searchlight buying in a 50% stake.
Slumdog Millionaire was first shown at the Telluride Film Festival on 30 August 2008, where it was positively received by audiences, generating "strong buzz".
The film also screened at the Toronto International Film Festival on 7 September 2008, where it was "the first widely acknowledged popular success" of the festival, winning the People's Choice Award.
Slumdog Millionaire debuted with an "impressive" limited North American release on 12 November 2008, grossing $350,434 in 10 theatres, a "strong" average of $35,043 per theatre.
In its second weekend, it expanded to 32 theatres and made $947,795, or an average of $29,619 per theatre, representing a drop of only 16%.
In the 10 original theatres that it was released in, viewership went up 16%, and this is attributed to strong word-of-mouth.
As of 26 January 2009, the film has grossed $55,916,000 at the US box office.
The film opened at #1 at the UK box office.
The film set a UK box office record in the second week, when the film's takings increased by 47%.
This is the "biggest ever increase for a UK saturation release," breaking "the record previously held by Billy Elliot's 13%".
This record-breaking "ticket surge" in the second week came after Slumdog Millionaire won four Golden Globes and received eleven BAFTA nominations.
The film has grossed £6.1 million in its first eleven days of release in the UK.
The Indian premiere of Slumdog Millionaire took place in Mumbai on 22 January 2009 and was attended by major personalities of the Indian film industry.
More than a hundred Indian film personalities attended this event.
A dubbed Hindi version, Slumdog Crorepati (स्लंडोग् करोड़पति), was also released in India in addition to the original version of the film.
Originally titled, Slumdog Millionaire: Kaun Banega Crorepati, the name was shortened for copyright purposes.
Loveleen Tandan, who supervised the dubbing, stated: "All the actors from the original English including Anil Kapoor, Irrfan Khan and Ankur Vikal dubbed the film.
We got a boy from Chembur Pradeep Motwani to dub for the male lead Dev Patel.
I didn't want any exaggerated dubbing.
I wanted a young unspoilt voice".
Critical reception
Reactions from the Western world
Slumdog Millionaire has been critically acclaimed in the West.
As of 24 January 2009, Rotten Tomatoes has given the film a 95% rating with a 175 fresh and ten rotten reviews.
The average score is 8.3/10.
At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film has received an average score of 86, based on 36 reviews.
Movie City News shows that the film appeared in 123 different top ten lists, out of 286 different critics lists surveyed, the 3rd most mentions on a top ten list of any film released in 2008.
Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times gave the film four stars, stating that it is, "a breathless, exciting story, heartbreaking and exhilarating".
Wall Street Journal critic Joe Morgenstern refers to Slumdog Millionaire as, "the film world's first globalized masterpiece".
Ty Burr of the Boston Globe describes the film as a "sprawling, madly romantic fairy-tale epic is the kind of deep-dish audience-rouser we've long given up hoping for from Hollywood".
Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post argues that, "this modern-day "rags-to-rajah" fable won the audience award at the Toronto International Film Festival earlier this year, and it's easy to see why.
With its timely setting of a swiftly globalizing India and, more specifically, the country's own version of the "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" TV show, combined with timeless melodrama and a hardworking orphan who withstands all manner of setbacks, "Slumdog Millionaire" plays like Charles Dickens for the 21st century".Todd McCarthy of Variety, praises the script as "intricate and cleverly structured", the cinematography by Anthony Dod Mantle's, and Chris Dickens' editing as "breathless" He concludes that, "as drama and as a look at a country increasingly entering the world spotlight, Slumdog Millionaire is a vital piece of work by an outsider who’s clearly connected with the place".
Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times describes the film as "a Hollywood-style romantic melodrama that delivers major studio satisfactions in an ultra-modern way", and the "hard-to-resist 'Slumdog Millionaire,' with director Danny Boyle adding independent film touches to a story of star-crossed romance that the original Warner brothers would have embraced, shamelessly pulling out stops that you wouldn't think anyone would have the nerve to attempt anymore".
Manohla Dargis of The New York Times,  calls the film "a modern fairy tale," a "sensory blowout," and "one of the most upbeat stories about living in hell imaginable".
She concludes that "In the end, what gives me reluctant pause about this bright, cheery, hard-to-resist movie is that its joyfulness feels more like a filmmaker’s calculation than an honest cry from the heart about the human spirit".
Peter Brunette of the Hollywood Reporter, while giving it a positive review, states the film is "a high-octane hybrid of Danny Boyle's patented cinematic overkill and Bollywood's ultra-energetic genre conventions that is a little less good than the hype would have it".
Several other reviewers have described Slumdog Millionaire as a Bollywood-style "Masala" movie, due to the way the film combines "familiar raw ingredients into a feverish masala" and culminates in "the romantic leads finding each other".
Other critics offered mixed reviews.
Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian gave the film three out of five stars, stating that "despite the extravagant drama and some demonstrations of the savagery meted out to India's street children, this is a cheerfully undemanding and unreflective film with a vision of India that, if not touristy exactly, is certainly an outsider's view; it depends for its full enjoyment on not being taken too seriously".
Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle states that, "Slumdog Millionaire has a problem in its storytelling.
The movie unfolds in a start-and-stop way that kills suspense, leans heavily on flashbacks and robs the movie of most of its velocity.
The filmmakers' motives are sincere.
The story is interesting enough.
Yet the whole construction is tied to a gimmicky narrative strategy that keeps Slumdog Millionaire from really hitting its stride until the last 30 minutes.
By then, it's just a little too late".
Eric Hynes of IndieWIRE panned the film and wrote it is "bombastic" and "a noisy, sub-Dickens update on the romantic tramp's tale" and faulted the film's glossy and sentimental portrayal of societal poverty, and described it as "a goofy picaresque to rival Forrest Gump" in its morality and romanticism.
Reactions from India and Indian diaspora
The film has been a subject of discussion among a variety of people in India and the Indian diaspora.
Among film critics, Nikhat Kazmi of the Times of India calls it "a piece of riveting cinema, meant to be savoured as a Cinderella-like fairy tale, with the edge of a thriller and the vision of an artist".
He also argues against criticism of the film stating that, "it was never meant to be a documentary on the down and out in Dharavi.
And it isn't".
Renuka Vyavahare of Indiatimes suggests that, "the film is indeed very Indian" and that it is "one of the best English films set in India and revolving around the country’s most popular metropolis Mumbai".
Kaveree Bamzai of India Today calls the film "feisty" and argues that it is "Indian at its core and Western in its technical flourish".
Anand Giridharadas argues in The New York Times that the film has a "freshness" which "portrays a changing India, with great realism, as something India long resisted being: a land of self-makers, where a scruffy son of the slums can, solely of his own effort, hoist himself up, flout his origins, break with fate".
Giridharadas  also calls the film "a tribute to the irrepressible self".
Poorna Shetty states in the The Guardian that "Boyle's depiction of Mumbai is spot on".
She further states that the film displays the "human aspect of the slums and the irrepressible energy and life force of the place" and "a breathing snapshot of the city that is always stripped of its warmth when depicted in the news".
On the other hand, film critic Gautaman Bhaskaran questioned the "euphoria in India" in a review for The Seoul Times after the film's release there, arguing that with a few exceptions, "there is nothing Indian about this film".
Bhaskaran questions inconsistencies in the plot and concludes that it is a film of "very little substance" as well as "superficial and insensitive".
Another film critic (author of The Essential Guide to Bollywood), Subhash K. Jha, also states in Bollywood Hungama that he found the film "over-hyped and disappointing" and also suggests that the territory has already been covered by Indian filmmakers (Mira Nair in Salaam Bombay and Satyajit Ray in the Apu Trilogy).
Soutik Biswas of the BBC further argues that Slumdog Millionaire is an imitation of Indian films that have been "routinely ignored" and suggests that, "if you are looking for gritty realism set in the badlands of Mumbai, order a DVD of a film called Satya by Ramgopal Verma.
The 1998 feature on an immigrant who is sucked into Mumbai's colourful underworld makes Slumdog look like a slick, uplifting MTV docu-drama".
A few authors and filmmakers have offered their insights of the film.
Salman Rushdie stated in an interview with the New York Times that he is "not a very big fan" of Slumdog Millionaire.
He further commented: "I think it’s visually brilliant.
But I have problems with the story line.
I find the storyline unconvincing.
It just couldn’t happen.
I’m not adverse to magic realism but there has to be a level of plausibility, and I felt there were three or four moments in the film where the storyline breached that rule".
Bishakha Dutta, a well-known documentary filmmaker who has made several films about Mumbai slums, criticized Slumdog Millionaire for "taking each and every cliche there is about India and Mumbai and puts it in its plot.
The result is a film that takes you from one horror of Mumbai to another, in a plot that is incredulously unbelievable".
Radha Chadha, co-author of  The Cult of the Luxury Brand: Inside Asia's Love Affair with Luxury (with Paul Husband), offers an analysis of the film in Livemint.
She argues that while Slumdog Millionaire is entertaining, it is still a "masala film," the kind of Bollywood product which Indians grow up watching.
As to its popularity in the West, she further suggests that what is "ordinary" (in terms of film genre) for an Indian audience, "is extraordinary for the world"  and that "the mesmerizing soft power of Bollywood which has kept a billion Indians enthralled for decades is touching the rest of the world".
Scholars have also responded to the film.
Asst.
Professor of sociology (Wellesley College), Smitha Radhakrishnan, states in UCLA's Asia Pacific Arts journal that the film offers "an action-packed, devastating, intriguing, and oddly beautiful world".
Radhakrishnan also argues that while its "outsider's" view offers an "unexpected advantage," there were notable "slip-ups" of which the "most glaring was the language.
Despite the plausible explanation that Jamal and Salim picked up English, posing as tour guides at the Taj Mahal, it is highly implausible that they would come out of that experience speaking perfect British English, as Dev Patel does in portraying the grown-up Jamal.
It's highly implausible that he would speak to Latika and Salim in English as an adult too".
Professor Vrinda Nabar, the former Chair of English at the University of Mumbai, argues that the film ignores the "complexity" of Mumbai as "a city in which sensitivity coexists with despair, commitment with indifference, activism with inaction, and humanism with the inhumane".
Awards and honours
Slumdog Millionaire is highly acclaimed, named in the top ten lists of a number of newspapers.
It won four Golden Globe awards and five Critics Choice Awards and has been nominated for eleven BAFTA Awards and ten Academy Awards.
Soundtrack
The Slumdog Millionaire soundtrack was composed by A. R. Rahman who planned the score over two months and completed it in two weeks.
Rahman won the 2009 Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score and earned three Academy Award nominations, including one for Best Original Score and two for Best Original Song, one with M.I.A.
for the song "O..Saya" and the other solo for "Jai Ho" shared with lyricist Gulzar.
The soundtrack was released on M.I.A.
's record label N.E.E.T.
Radio Sargam termed the soundtrack "magnum opus and the entire world is known to this fact".
Controversies
Loveleen Tandan
After the nominations for the 66th Golden Globe Awards were announced, a Chicago film critic launched an online campaign to demand that Loveleen Tandan, who Danny Boyle appointed as co-director for the film, be nominated for Best Director alongside Boyle at the Golden Globes and the 81st Academy Awards.
The campaign organizer Jan Lisa Huttner stated: "If she's co-director during the filmmaking and marketing process, why isn't she co-nominee when the awards are passed out?
" She noted "how rare it is for female directors to be in the awards race".
After finding out about this campaign, Tandan sought to end it, stating, "I can't tell you how embarrassed I am by this [...] The suggestion is highly inappropriate, and I am writing to you to stress that I would not wish it to be considered".
Slumdog Millionaire's producer Christian Colson says Tandan's credit is being misconstrued to mean she is on equal creative footing with Boyle.
Colson stated that Tandan's title was "strange but deserved" and was developed over "a Coca Cola and a cup of tea" in order to identify her as "one of our key cultural bridges".
Amitabh Bachchan
One of the first celebrities thought to have discussed the film was "India's biggest superstar" Amitabh Bachchan, from whom young Jamal eagerly seeks an autograph in the beginning of the film and who was the original presenter for Kaun Banega Crorepati, the Indian version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?
He has an entry on his blog dated 13 January 2009 stating that on another part of his blog there were "comments for the film ‘SlumDog Millionaire’" which he noted indicated "anger by some on its contents".
He further states that, "if SM projects India as Third World dirty under belly developing nation and causes pain and disgust among nationalists and patriots, let it be known that a murky under belly exists and thrives even in the most developed nations".
Bachchan also states: "It's just that the SM idea authored by an Indian and conceived and cinematically put together by a Westerner, gets creative Globe recognition.
The other would perhaps not".
This entry was widely reported on by the press as a criticism of the film.
In a later entry,  Bachchan responded to these media reports by stating: "Fact is - some one mentioned the film on my blog.
Some expressed opinion for it, some against.
And yes, they contained some strong assumptions.
I merely put both of them up and invited debate [...] Media, in India has taken the pros and cons of OTHERS,  as MINE, built their headlines and put it safely out, thereby, causing the consternation.
All the expressions that have been attributed to me are in fact the expressions of others".
In another entry, Bachchan states that Anil Kapoor invited him by phone to the premiere of the film.
During the same phone call, Bachchan also spoke with Danny Boyle and described him as "gracious and complimentary to me and my work".
Bachchan states that he offered his "apologies" over headlines "created by media" and that Boyle "understands and acknowledges my calling him".
Lawsuits and protests
After its release in India, the film currently fared poorly among the public, with the widespread belief that the film fuels western stereotypes about poverty in India, and that the film peddles "poverty porn" and "slum voyeurism".
Tapeshwar Vishwakarma, a representative of a slum-dwellers' welfare group, has filed a defamation lawsuit against the film's music composer A.R.
Rahman and actor Anil Kapoor, alleging that slum-dwellers were depicted in a bad light which would be a violation of their human rights.
Vishwakarma's lawsuit alleged that the name of the movie is derogatory and he was particularly displeased that Indians associated with the film did not object to the use of word "slumdog".
Nicholas Almeida, a social activist working in Mumbai, organized a protest against the film on the grounds that it intentionally exploited the poor for the purposes of profit, and that the title 'Slumdog millionaire" was offensive, demeaning and insulted their dignity.
The protesters were slum dwellers in Mumbai who objected to being dehumanized as "dogs" in the film title.
The signs that they bore ranged from "I am poor, but don't call me Slumdog" to "I am not a slumdog, I am the future of India".
