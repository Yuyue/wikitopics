John Muir (21 April 1838 – 24 December 1914) was a Scottish-born American naturalist, author, and early advocate of preservation of U.S. wilderness.
His letters, essays, and books telling of his adventures in nature, especially in the Sierra Nevada mountain range of California, have been read by millions and are still popular today.
His activism helped to save the Yosemite Valley, Sequoia National Park and other wilderness areas.
The Sierra Club, which he founded, is now one of the most important conservation organizations in the United States.
What is considered the "most famous" and most scenic hiking trail in America, the 212-mile John Muir Trail was named in his honor.
Other places named in his honor are Muir Woods National Monument, Muir Beach and Muir Glacier
In his later life, Muir devoted most of his time to the preservation of the Western forests.
He petitioned Congress for the National Park Bill that was passed in 1899, establishing both Yosemite and Sequoia National Parks, and was the first to demonstrate that Yosemite Valley had been formed by glacial erosion..
Muir's biographer, Steven Holmes, states that Muir has become "one of the patron saints of twentieth-century American environmental activity," both political and recreational.
As a result, his writings are commonly discussed in books and journals, and he is often quoted in books by nature photographers such as Ansel Adams.
"Muir has profoundly shaped the very categories through which Americans understand and envision their relationships with the natural world," writes Holmes.
He was noted for being an ecological thinker, political spokesman, and religious prophet, whose writings became a personal guide into nature for countless individuals, making his name "almost ubiquitous" in the modern environmental consciousness.
According to author William Anderson, Muir exemplified "the archetype of our oneness with the earth".
Early life
John Muir was born in Dunbar, East Lothian, Scotland to Daniel Muir and Ann Gilrye.
He was one of eight children: Margaret, Sarah, David, Daniel, Ann and Mary (twins), and the American-born Joanna.
In his autobiography, he described his boyhood pursuits, which included fighting, either by re-enacting romantic battles of Scottish history or just scrapping on the playground, and hunting for birds' nests (ostensibly to one-up his fellows as they compared notes on who knew where the most were located).
In 1849, Muir's family emigrated to the United States, starting a farm near Portage, Wisconsin called Fountain Lake Farm, which is a National Historic Landmark.
Stephen Fox recounts that Muir's father found the Church of Scotland insufficiently strict in faith and practice, leading to their emigration and joining a congregation of the Campbellite Restoration Movement.
Fox relates that, by age 11, young Muir had learned to recite "by heart and by sore flesh" all of the New Testament and most of the Old Testament.
But in maturity, Muir was never confused by orthodox beliefs.
In a letter to his fond friend Emily Pelton, dated 23 May 1865, he wrote, "I never tried to abandon creeds or code of civilization; they went away of their own accord... without leaving any consciousness of loss".
Elsewhere in his writings, he described the conventional image of a Creator, "as purely a manufactured article as any puppet of a half-penny theater".
He remained though a deeply religious man writing, "We all flow from one fountain—Soul.
All are expressions of one love.
God does not appear, and flow out, only from narrow chinks and round bored wells here and there in favored races and places, but He flows in grand undivided currents, shoreless and boundless over creeds and forms and all kinds of civilizations and peoples and beasts, saturating all and fountainizing all".
At age 22, Muir enrolled  at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, paying his own way for several years.
There, under a towering black locust tree beside North Hall, Muir took his first botany lesson.
A fellow student plucked a flower from the tree and used it to explain how the grand locust is a member of the pea family, related to the straggling pea plant.
Fifty years later, the naturalist Muir described the day in his autobiography.
"This fine lesson charmed me and sent me flying to the woods and meadows in wild enthusiasm".
Muir was an erstwhile student, attending classes for two years, but never being listed higher than a first year student due to his unusual selection of courses.
Records showed his class status as "irregular gent," and even though he never graduated, he learned enough geology and botany to inform his later wanderings.
In 1864, Muir left school to go to Canada, spending the spring, summer, and fall wandering the woods and swamps around Lake Huron collecting plants.
With his money running out and winter coming, he met his brother Daniel in Ontario, where the two worked at a sawmill on the shore of Lake Huron until the summer of 1865.
Muir's trip to Canada was likely influenced by the Civil War draft.
By 1864, President Lincoln was calling up another half million soldiers, and Muir's chances of getting drafted were becoming increasingly likely.
Roderick Nash has described Muir's travels in Canada as journeys into wilderness to avoid military service, while Linnie Marsh Wolfe wrote that Muir decided that if his number wasn't picked in the draft—which it wasn't—he "would wander a while" in the Canadian wilderness.
Muir worked at the mill until March 1866, returning to the United States to work as an industrial engineer in Indianapolis.
He became extremely valuable to his employers with his inventiveness in improving the machines, processes, and lives of the laborers at a plant that manufactured carriage parts.
In early March 1867, an accident changed the course of his life.
A sharp file pierced his right eye, making it temporarily blind.
With the liquid from his eye dripping into his hand, thinking the eye was permanently blinded, he later said, "I would gladly have died where I stood".
After four weeks in a darkened room, his eye mostly healed, Muir went on a short walk.
When he returned, he was determined to "be true to myself" and follow his dream of exploration and study of plants.
In September 1867, Muir undertook a walk of about   from Indiana to Florida, which he recounted in his book A Thousand-Mile Walk to the Gulf.
He had no specific route chosen, except to go by the "wildest, leafiest, and least trodden way I could find".
Upon reaching Florida, he hoped to board a ship to South America and continue his wandering there.
He contracted malaria on Florida's Gulf Coast, which convinced him to abandon his plans for South America.
Instead, he sailed to New York where he booked passage to California.
Explorer of nature
California
Yosemite
Arriving in San Francisco in March 1868, Muir immediately left for a place he had only read about called Yosemite.
After seeing Yosemite Valley for the first time he was captivated, and wrote, "No temple made with hands can compare with Yosemite...
The grandest of all special temples of Nature".
After his initial eight-day visit, he returned to Yosemite and worked as a sheepherder for a season.
The next year, 1869, Muir took a job in the Yosemite Valley building a sawmill for James Mason Hutchings.
In his free time he wandered through Yosemite, where he eventually developed the theory that the valley had been carved by glaciers.
During these periods he climbed Cathedral Peak, Mount Dana and hiked the old Indian trail down Bloody Canyon to Mono Lake.
A natural born inventor, Muir designed a water-powered mill to cut wind-felled trees and he built himself a small cabin along Yosemite Creek  and designed it so that a section of the stream would flow through a corner of the room so he could enjoy the sound of running water.
He lived in the cabin for two years,  and wrote about this period his book First Summer in the Sierra (1911).
Muir biographer Frederick Turner notes Muir's journal entry upon first visiting the valley and writes that his description "blazes from the page with the authentic force of a conversion experience".
We are now in the mountains and they are in us, kindling enthusiasm, making every nerve quiver, filling every pore and cell of us.
Our flesh-and-bone tabernacle seems transparent as glass to the beauty about us, as if truly an inseparable part of it, thrilling with the air and trees, streams and rock, in the waves of the sun, — a part of all nature, neither old nor young, sick nor well, but immortal.
.
.
.
How glorious a conversion, so complete and wholesome it is, scarce memory enough of old bondage days .
.
.
In this newness of life we seem to have been so always.
During these years in Yosemite Muir was unmarried, often unemployed, with no prospects for a career, and had "periods of anguish," writes naturalist author John Tallmadge.
He was sustained by not only the natural environment, but also by reading the essays of naturalist author Ralph Waldo Emerson, who wrote about the very life that Muir was then living.
On Muir's excursions into the back country of Yosemite, he traveled alone, carrying "only a tin cup, a handful of tea, a loaf of bread, and a copy of Emerson".
He usually spent his evenings sitting around a campfire in his overcoat, reading Emerson under the stars.
As the years passed, he became a "fixture in the valley," respected for his knowlege of natural history, his skill as a guide, and his vivid storytelling.
Visitors to the valley often included scientists, artists, and celebrities, many of whom made a point of meeting with Muir.
In 1871, after Muir had lived in Yosemite for three years, Emerson, with a number of academic friends from Boston, arrived in Yosemite during a tour of the Western United States.
The two men met, and according to Tallmadge, "Emerson was delighted to find at the end of his career the prophet-naturalist he had called for so long ago.
.
.
And for Muir, Emerson's visit came like a laying on of hands".
Emerson spent only the one day with Muir, although he offered him a teaching position at Harvard, which Muir declined.
Muir later wrote, "I never for a moment thought of giving up God's big show for a mere profship!
"
Geological studies and theories
Pursuit of his love of science, especially geology, often occupied his free time and he soon became convinced that glaciers had sculpted many of the features of the valley and surrounding area.
This notion was in stark contradiction to the accepted theory of the day, promulgated by Josiah Whitney (head of the California Geological Survey), which attributed the formation of the valley to a catastrophic earthquake.
As Muir's ideas spread, Whitney would try to discredit Muir by branding him as an amateur and even an ignoramus.
But the premier geologist of the day, Louis Agassiz saw merit in Muir's ideas, and lauded him as "the first man I have ever found who has any adequate conception of glacial action".
In 1871, Muir discovered an active alpine glacier below Merced Peak, which further helped his theories to gain acceptance.
He was also a highly productive writer and had many of his accounts and papers published as far away as New York.
Also that year, one of Muir's heroes, Ralph Waldo Emerson, arrived in Yosemite and sought out Muir.
Muir's former professor at the University of Wisconsin, Ezra Carr, and Carr's wife, Jeanne, encouraged Muir to publish his ideas.
They also introduced Muir to notables such as Emerson, as well as many leading scientists such as Louis Agassiz, John Tyndall, John Torrey, Clinton Hart Merriam, and Joseph LeConte.
A large earthquake centered near Lone Pine, California in Owens Valley (see 1872 Lone Pine earthquake) was felt very strongly in Yosemite Valley in March 1872.
The quake woke Muir in the early morning and he ran out of his cabin "both glad and frightened," exclaiming, "A noble earthquake!
" Other valley settlers, who still adhered to Whitney's ideas, feared that the quake was a prelude to a cataclysmic deepening of the valley.
Muir had no such fear and promptly made a moonlit survey of new talus piles created by earthquake-triggered rockslides.
This event led more people to believe in Muir's ideas about the formation of the valley.
Botanical studies
In addition to his geologic studies, Muir also investigated the plant life of the Yosemite area.
In 1873 and 1874, he made field studies along the western flank of the Sierra on the distribution and ecology of isolated groves of Giant Sequoia.
In 1876, the American Association for the Advancement of Science published Muir's paper on the subject.
In the introduction he explained his purpose:
During the past summer I explored the Sequoia belt of the Sierra Nevada, tracing its boundaries and learning what I could of the post-glacial history of the specias, and of its future prospects.
.
.
.
Some of the answers obtained to these questions, seem plain and full of significance, and cannot I think, fail to interest every student of natural history.
Northwest
In 1888 after seven years of managing the ranch his health began to suffer.
With his wife's prompting he returned to the hills to recover his old self, climbing Mt.
Rainier and writing Ascent of Mount Rainier.
Muir travelled with the party that landed on Wrangel Island on the USS Corwin and claimed that island for the United States in 1881.
He documented this experience in his book The Cruise of the Corwin.
Activism and controversies
Preservation efforts
Establishing Yosemite National Park
Muir threw himself into the preservationist role with great vigor.
He envisioned the Yosemite area and the Sierra as pristine lands.
He saw the greatest threat to the Yosemite area and the Sierra to be livestock, especially domestic sheep, calling them "hoofed locusts".
In June 1889, the influential associate editor of Century magazine, Robert Underwood Johnson, camped with Muir in Tuolumne Meadows and saw firsthand the damage a large flock of sheep had done to the grassland.
Johnson agreed to publish any article Muir wrote on the subject of excluding livestock from the Sierra high country.
He also agreed to use his influence to introduce a bill to Congress to make the Yosemite area into a national park, modeled after Yellowstone National Park.
On 30 September 1890, the U.S. Congress passed a bill that essentially followed recommendations that Muir had suggested in two Century articles, The Treasure of the Yosemite and Features of the Proposed National Park, both published in 1890.
But to Muir's dismay, the bill left Yosemite Valley in state control.
Co-founding the Sierra Club
In early 1892, Professor Henry Senger, a philologist at the University of California, Berkeley contacted Muir with the idea of forming a local 'alpine club' for mountain lovers.
Senger and San Francisco attorney Warren Olney sent out invitations "for the purpose of forming a 'Sierra Club.
' Mr. John Muir will preside".
On May 28, 1892, the first meeting of the Sierra Club was held to write articles of incorporation.
One week later Muir was elected president, Olney vice-president, and a board of directors was chosen that included David Starr Jordan, president of the new Stanford University.
Muir would remain president until his death 22 years later.
The Sierra Club immediately opposed efforts to reduce Yosemite National Park by half, and began holding educational and scientific meetings.
One meeting in the fall of 1895 that included Muir, Joseph LeConte, and William R. Dudley discussed the idea of establishing 'national forest reservations', which would later be called National Forests.
The Sierra Club was active in the successful campaign to transfer Yosemite National Park from state to federal control in 1906.
The fight to preserve Hetch Hetchy Valley was also taken up by the Sierra Club, with some prominent San Francisco members opposing the fight.
Eventually a vote was held that overwhelmingly put the Sierra Club behind the opposition to Hetch Hetchy Dam.
Preservation vs conservation
In July 1896 Muir became associated with Gifford Pinchot, a national leader in the conservation movement.
Pinchot was the first head of the United States Forest Service and a leading spokesman for the sustainable use of natural resources for the benefit of the people.
His views eventually clashed with Muir and highlighted two diverging views of the use of the country's natural resources.
Pinchot saw conservation as a means of managing the nation's natural resources for long-term sustainable commercial use.
As a professional forester, his view was that "forestry is tree farming," without destroying the long term viability of the forests.
Muir valued nature for its spiritual and transcendental qualities.
In one essay about the National Parks, he referred to them as "places for rest, inspiration, and prayers".
He often encouraged city dwellers to experience nature for its spiritual nourishment.
Both men opposed reckless exploitation of natural resources, including clear-cutting of forests.
Even Muir acknowledged the need for timber and the forests to provide it, but Pinchot's view of wilderness management was far more utilitarian.
Their friendship ended late in the summer of 1897 when Pinchot released a statement to a Seattle newspaper supporting sheep grazing in forest reserves.
Muir confronted Pinchot and demanded an explanation.
When Pinchot reiterated his position Muir told him: "I don't want any thing more to do with you".
This philosophical divide soon expanded and split the conservation movement into two camps: the preservationists, led by Muir, and Pinchot's camp, who co-opted the term "conservation".
The two men debated their positions in popular magazines such as Outlook, Harper's Weekly, Atlantic Monthly, World's Work, and Century.
Their contrasting views were highlighted again when the United States was deciding whether to dam Hetch Hetchy Valley.
Pinchot favored the damming of the valley as "the highest possible use which could be made of it".
In contrast, Muir proclaimed, "Dam Hetch Hetchy!
As well dam for water-tanks the people's cathedrals and churches, for no holier temple has ever been consecrated by the hearts of man".
In 1899, Muir accompanied railroad executive E. H. Harriman and other esteemed scientists on the famous exploratory voyage along the Alaska coast aboard the luxuriously refitted   steamer the George W. Elder.
He would later rely on his friendship with Harriman to apply political pressure on Congress to pass conservation legislation.
In 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt accompanied Muir on a visit to Yosemite.
Muir joined Roosevelt in Oakland, California for the train trip to Raymond.
The presidential entourage then traveled by stagecoach into the park.
While traveling to the park, Muir told the president about state mismanagement of the valley and rampant exploitation of the valley's resources.
Even before they entered the park, he was able to convince Roosevelt that the best way to protect the valley was through federal control and management.
After entering the park and seeing the magnificent splendor of the valley, the president asked Muir to show him the real Yosemite.
Muir and Roosevelt set off largely by themselves and camped in the back country.
The duo talked late into the night, slept in the brisk open air of Glacier Point, and were dusted by a fresh snowfall in the morning.
It was a night Roosevelt would never forget.
Muir then increased efforts by the Sierra Club to consolidate park management and was rewarded in 1905 when Congress transferred the Mariposa Grove and Yosemite Valley to the park.
Helping Native Americans
Muir's attitude toward Native Americans evolved over the course of his life.
His earliest encounters were with the weary tribes of Winnebago Indians in Wisconsin, who begged for food and stole his favorite horse.
In spite of that, he had a great deal of sympathy for them for "being robbed of their lands and pushed ruthlessly back into narrower and narrower limits by alien races who were cutting off their means of livelihood".
His early encounters with the Digger Indians in California left him feeling ambivalent after seeing their lifestyle, which he described as "lazy" and "superstitious".
Carolyn Merchant criticized Muir, believing that he wrote disparagingly of the Native Americans he encountered in his early explorations.
Later, after living with them, he praised and grew more respectful of Native Americans for their low impact on the wilderness compared to the heavy impact by white men.
Hetch Hetchy dam controversy
Pressure started growing to dam the Tuolumne River for use as a water reservoir for San Francisco.
Muir passionately opposed the damming of Hetch Hetchy Valley because he found Hetch Hetchy more stunning even than Yosemite Valley.
Muir, the Sierra Club and Robert Underwood Johnson fought against inundating the valley and Muir wrote to Roosevelt pleading for him to scuttle the project.
Roosevelt's successor, William Howard Taft suspended the interior Department's approval for the Hetch Hetchy right-of-way.
After years of national debate, Taft's successor Woodrow Wilson signed the bill into law on December 19, 1913.
Muir felt a great loss from the destruction of the valley, his last major battle.
Nature writer
While he was alive, Muir had published six volumes of his writings all describing his explorations of natural settings, with four additional books that were published after he died.
Several other books were subsequently published which included his essays and articles which were assembled from various sources.
Miller writes that what was most important about his writings was not in their quantity, however, but their "quality".
He notes that they have had a "lasting effect on American culture in helping to create the desire and will to protect and preserve wild and natural environments".
His first appearance in print was by accident, writes Miller, in that someone whom he did not even know submitted, without his permission or awareness, a personal letters to a lady friend describing a rare flower he came across, generic name, Calypso borealis.
The article was published anonymously as having been authored by an "inspired pilgrim".
Throughout his many years as a naturalist writer he would commonly rewrite and expand on earlier writings from his journals and magazine articles.
He would often compile and organize these earlier writings and have them published as a collection of essays or included as part of narrative books.
Miller speculates that this recycling of earlier writings could partly be due to Muir's "dislike of the writing process".
He adds that Muir "did not enjoy the work, finding it difficult and tedious".
Whatsmore, he was generally unsatisfied with the finished result, finding prose "a weak instrument for the reality he wished to convey".
However, he was prodded by friends and his wife to keep writing and as a result of their influence he kept at it, although never satisfied.
Muir wrote in 1872, "No amount of word-making will ever make a single soul to know these mountains.
One day's exposure to mountains is better than a cartload of books".
In one of his essays written in 1918, he gave an example of the deficiencies of writing verses experiencing nature:
...a tourist's frightened rush and scramble through the woods yields far less than the hunter's wildest stories, while in writing we can do but little more than to give a few names, as they come to mind, — beaver, squirrel, coon, fox, marten, fisher, otter, ermine, wildcat, — only this instead of full descriptions of the bright-eyed furry throng, their snug home nests, their fears and fights and loves, how they get their food, rear their young, escape their enemies, and keep themselves warm and well and exquisitely clean through all the pitiless weather.
Philosophical beliefs
Of nature and theology
Muir understood that if he hoped to discover truth he had to turn to what he believed to be the most accurate sources.
In his book, The Story of My Boyhood and Youth (1913), he writes that during his childhood his father made him read the Bible every day, and he had eventually memorized three fourths of the Old Testament and all of the New Testament.
Historian Dennis Williams adds that his father had read Josephus's War of the Jews in order to understand the culture of first-century Palestine, as it was written by an eyewitness, and would illuminate the culture during the period of the New Testament.
But as Muir became attached to the American natural landscapes he explored, Williams notes that he began to see another "primary source for understanding God: the Book of Nature".
According to Williams, in nature, especially in the wilderness, Muir was able to study the plants and animals in an environment that he believed "came straight from the hand of God, uncorrupted by civilization and domestication".
As Tallmadge notes, Muir's belief in this "Book of Nature" made him feel compelled to tell the story of "this creation in words any reader could understand".
As a result, his writings were to become "prophecy, for [they] sought to change our angle of vision".
Williams notes that Muir's philosophy and world view rotated around his perceived dichotomy between civilization and nature.
From this developed his core belief that "wild is superior".
His nature writings would become a "synthesis of natural theology" with scripture which would help him understand the origins of the natural world.
According to Williams, philosophers and theologians such as Thomas Dick suggested to him that the "best place to discover the true attributes of deity was in Nature".
He came to believe that God was always active in the creation of life and thereby kept the natural order of the world.
As a result, Muir "styled himself as a John the Baptist," adds Williams, "whose duty was to immerse in 'mountain baptism' everyone he could".
Williams concludes that Muir saw nature as a great teacher, "revealing the mind of God," and this belief would become the central theme of his later journeys and the "subtext" of his nature writing.
During his career as writer and while living in the mountains, he would continue to experience the "presence of the the divine in nature," writes Holmes  From Travels in Alaska: "Every particle of rock or water or air has God by its side leading it the way it should go; The clearest way into the Universe is through a forest wilderness; In God's wildness is the hope of the world".
His personal letters would also convey these feelings of ecstasy, with theologian Catherine Albanese stating that in one of his letters, "Muir's eucharist made Thoreau's feast on wood-chuck and huckleberry seem almost anemic".
She adds that "Muir had successfully taken biblical language and inverted it to proclaim the passion of attachment, not to a supernatural world but to a natural one.
To go to the mountains and sequoia forests, for Muir, was to engage in religious worship of utter seriousness and dedication".
She quotes Muir's letter:
Do behold the King in his glory, King Sequoia.
Behold!
Behold!
seems all I can say.
Some time ago I left all for Sequoia: have been and am at his feet fasting and praying for light, for is he not the greatest light in the woods; in the world.
Of sensory perceptions and light
During his first summer in the Sierras while he was a sheep-herder, Muir wrote field notes that emphasized the role that the senses play in human perceptions of the environment.
According to Williams, he speculated that the world was an unchanging entity that was interpreted by the brain through the senses, and, writes Muir, "If the creator were to bestow a new set of senses upon us .
.
.
we would never doubt that we were in another world.
.
.
"  While doing his studies of nature he would try to remember everything he observed as if his senses were recording the impressions, until he could write them in his journal.
As a result of his intense desire to remember facts, he filled his field journals with notes on precipitation, temperature, and even cloud formations.
However, Muir took his journal entries further than recording factual observations.
Williams notes that the observations he recorded amounted to a description of "the sublimity of Nature," and what amounted to "an aesthetic and spiritual notebook".
Muir felt that his task was more than just recording "phenomena," but also to "illuminate the spiritual implications of those phenomena," writes Williams.
For Muir, mountain skies, for example, seemed to be painted with light, and came to "symbolize divinity".
He would often describe his observations in terms of light, as exemplified in his writings from My First Summer in the Sierra (1911):
Of giant ferns: .
.
.
how soft and lovely the light streaming through this living ceiling, revealing the arching branching ribs and veins of the fronds as the framework of countless panes of pale green and yellow plant-glass nicely fitted together—a fairyland created out of the commonest fern-stuff.
Of spring: The light is peculiarly white and thin, though pleasantly warm.
The serenity of this mountain weather in the spring, just when Nature’s pulses are beating highest, is one of its greatest charms.
Of morning: And the dawns and sunrises and sundowns of these mountain days, —the rose light creeping higher among the stars, changing to daffodil yellow, the level beams bursting forth, streaming across the ridges, touching pine after pine, awakening and warming all the mighty host to do gladly their shining day’s work.
Of mountains: Oh, these vast, calm, measureless mountain days, inciting at once to work and rest!
Days in whose light everything seems equally divine, opening a thousand windows to show us God.
Muir biographer Steven Holmes has noted that Muir also used the words "glory" and "glorious" to suggest that light was taking on a religious dimension.
Holmes states, "It is impossible to overestimate the importance of the notion of glory in Muir's published writings, where no other single image carries more emotional or religious weight".
He also observes that because Muir had been raised with the Bible, "his decision to use the term would not have been random".
In fact his usage of "glory," according to Holmes, "exactly parallels its Hebraic origins," in which biblical writings often indicate a divine presence with light, as in the burning bush or pillar of fire, and described as "the glory of God".
Never before had I seen so glorious a landscape, so boundless an affluence of sublime mountain beauty.
.
.
.
dark upsweeeping forests, and glorious array of white peaks deep in the sky .
.
.
I do not understand the request of Moses, 'Show me they glory,' but if he were here .
.
.
after allowing him time to drink the glories of flower, mountain, and sky I would ask him how they compared with those of the Valley of the Nile .
.
.
and I would inquire how he had the conscience to ask for more glory when such oceans and atmospheres were about him.
King David was a better observer: 'The whole earth is full of thy glory.
'
Seeing nature as "home"
Muir would often use the term "home" as a metaphor for both nature and his general attitude toward the "natural world itself," notes Holmes.
He would often use domestic language to describe his scientific observations, as when he saw nature as providing a home for even the smallest plant life: "the little purple plant, tended by its Maker, closed its petals, crouched low in its crevice of a home, and enjoyed the storm in safety".
Muir also saw nature as his own home, as when he wrote friends and described the Sierras as "God's mountain mansion".
He considered not only the mountains as home, however, as he also felt a closeness even to the smallest objects: "The very stones seem talkative, sympathetic, brotherly.
No wonder when we consider that we all have the same Father and Mother".
In his later years, he would use the metaphor of nature as "home" in his writings to promote wilderness preservation.
In one of his essays aimed at the common person he wrote, "Thousands of tired, nerve-shaken, over-civilized people are beginning to find out that going to the mountains is going home; that wilderness is a necessity; and that mountain parks and reservations are useful not only as fountains of timber and irrigating rivers, but as fountains of life".
Not surprisingly, Muir's deep-seeted feeling about nature as being his true "home" led to tension with his family at his home in Martinez, California.
He once told a visitor to his ranch there, "This is agood place to be housed in during stormy weather, .
.
.
to write in, and to raise children in, but it is not my home.
Up there, pointing towards the Sierra Nevada, 'is my home.
'"
Personal life
In 1880, Muir married Louisa Wanda Strentzel, whose parents owned a large ranch and fruit orchards in Martinez, California, a small town northeast of San Francisco.
For the next ten years he devoted himself to managing the family ranch, consisting of   of orchards and vineyards, which became very successful.
During this time his daughters Wanda and Helen were born.
Muir's wife Louisa died on 6 August 1905.
When he died, he left an estate of US$250,000, worth more than US$5.1 million in 2007 dollars.
The house and part of the ranch are now a National Historical Site.
Death
John Muir died at California Hospital (now California Hospital Medical Center)  in Los Angeles on 24 December 1914 of pneumonia  after a brief visit to Daggett, California to see his daughter Helen Muir Funk.
