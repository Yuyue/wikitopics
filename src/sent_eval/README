The scripts for processing sentences and evaluating sentences.

number_sents.py
---------------
The script to number each sentence in the article.

Usage: number_sents.py /path/to/articles/ /path/to/sents/ /output/path/
	e.g. ./number_sents.py $WT_HOME/data/clustering/articles/2009-01-27 

Input:
	/path/to/articles/
		the path to the original texts of the articles. e.g. $WT_HOME/data/clustering/articles/2009-01-27
	/path/to/sents/
		the path to the sentences file to number. e.g. $WT_HOME/data/clustering/sentence-selection-ben/2009-01-27
	/output/path/
		the path to the numbered sentences file to output. e.g. $WT_HOME/data/clustering/sent_eval/ben/2009-01-27

Run:
	* 2010-12-11
	./number_sents.py /Users/bahn/work/wikitopics/data/clustering/sent/ben/2009-01-27/ /Users/bahn/work/wikitopics/data/clustering/articles/2009-01-27/ /Users/bahn/work/wikitopics/data/clustering/sent_eval/ben/

	The /Users/bahn/work/wikitopics/data/clustering/sent_eval/ben/George_W._Bush.sentences file was manually modified
	because the script could not find the line number of the first line.

eval_sents.py
-------------
The script to evaluation sentence selection against gold standard.
All subdirectories are recursively tested.

Usage: eval_sents.py test_dir gold_standard_dir
	e.g. ./eval_sents.py ../data/sent_eval/auto-first ../../data/sent_eval/ben

Input:
	each file in the test_dir directory only has one line:
	its best selection of sentence.
	the line has the line number of the selected selected and
	the sentence itself, separated by a space.

	each file in the gold_standard_dir directory has at least one line.
	each line in the files in the same format as those in the test_dir directory.
	the first line is the best choice, and the rest of the lines are the secondary choice.

	if the line number is -1, it means no sentences are selected.

Output:
	item_counts: The number of the test items.
	best_correct: The number of the correct best choice.
	best_guess: The number of the lines of the test data, whose line number is not -1.
	best_answer: The number of the liens of the gold standard data, whose line number is not -1.
	second_correct: The number of the choice that is either the best choice or
					one of the secondary choice.
	second_guess: Same as best_guess for now.
	second_answer: The number of the lines in the gold standard data including the best choice.

	Note that even if the best choice are both -1 both in the test data and in the gold standard data,
	They do not add up to the number of the correct choice.
