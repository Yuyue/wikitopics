Carol Ann Duffy, CBE, FRSL (born 23 December 1955, Glasgow) is a Scottish-born poet, playwright, and freelance writer, who currently holds the position of Britain's poet laureate.
She is the creative director of Manchester Metropolitan University's writing school.
She was awarded an OBE in 1995, and a CBE in 2002.
Duffy succeeded Andrew Motion as poet laureate on 1 May 2009.
She is the first woman, the first born in Scotland and the first openly bisexual person to hold the position, as well as the first laureate to be chosen in the 21st century.
Background
Early life
Carol Ann Duffy is the oldest child of Frank Duffy and May Black and she has four brothers.
Her family moved to Stafford when she was four years old.
Her father worked as a fitter for English Electric, stood as a parliamentary candidate for the Labour party and managed Stafford Rangers football club in his spare time.
Raised a Roman Catholic, she was educated at Saint Austin's Roman Catholic Primary School, St. Joseph's Convent School (now a nursing home for old people) and Stafford Girls' High School - where her literary talent was encouraged by English master J.
A. Walker.
She was also influenced by the poet Adrian Henri.
She was a passionate reader from an early age, and she always wanted to be a writer.
In 1977 she received an Honours Degree in Philosophy from the University of Liverpool.
Career
Duffy's poems provide voices for an extraordinary number of contemporary characters, including a fairground psychopath, a literary biographer, a newborn baby, disinherited American Indians, and even a ventriloquist's dummy .
Many of the poems reflect on time, change, and loss.
In dramatizing scenes of childhood, adolescence, and adult life, whether personal or public, contemporary or historical, she discovers moments of consolation through love, memory, and language.
She explores not only everyday experience, but also the rich fantasy life of herself and others .
Of her own writing, Duffy has said, "I'm not interested, as a poet, in words like 'plash'   Seamus Heaney words, interesting words.
I like to use simple words, but in a complicated way".
Singer-composer Eliana Tomkins, with whom Duffy collaborated on a series of live jazz recitals, says "With a lot of artists, the mystique is to baffle their readership.
She never does that.
Her aim is to communicate".
In her first collection Standing Female Nude (1985) she often uses the voices of outsiders, for example in the poems 'Education for Leisure' and 'Dear Norman'.
Her next collection Feminine Gospels (2002) continues this vein, showing an increased interest in long narrative poems, accessible in style and often surreal in their imagery.
Her 2005 publication, Rapture (2005), is a series of intimate poems charting the course of a love affair, for which she won the £10,000 T.S.
Eliot Prize.
In 2007 she published a poetry collection for children entitled The Hat.
Many British students read her work as set texts while studying for English Literature at GCSE and A-level, as she became part of the syllabus in England and Wales in 1994.
The poet has characterized her poetry using a simile: "Like the sand and the oyster, it's a creative irritant.
In each poem, I'm trying to reveal a truth, so it can't have a fictional beginning".
Online copies of her poems are extremely rare but her poem dedicated to U A Fanthorpe, Premonitions, is available online courtesy of The Guardian.
And some further poems are now presented by the Daily Mirror.
John Mullan wrote of her in the Guardian that
Over the past decade, Carol Ann Duffy has been the most popular living poet in Britain, her sales greatly helped by the fact that she has succeeded Hughes and Larkin as the most common representative of contemporary poetry in schools (and, it seems, the most commonly read writer of verse), but there are also aspects of her poetry that appeal to English teachers for good practical reasons.
Her poems are frequently humorous; they use clear schemes of rhyme and metre; they can be satisfactorily decoded by the diligent close reader.
According to the journalist Katharine Viner,
Her poems are accessible and entertaining, yet her form is classical, her technique razor-sharp.
She is read by people who don't really read poetry, yet she maintains the respect of her peers.
Reviewers praise her touching, sensitive, witty evocations of love, loss, dislocation, nostalgia; fans talk of greeting her at readings 'with claps and cheers that would not sound out of place at a pop concert'.
In August 2008, Duffy's poem "Education for Leisure" was removed from the AQA examination board's GCSE poetry anthology.
This followed a complaint from an external examiner relating to references to knife crime in the poem.
According to news reports, schools were urged to destroy copies of the unedited anthology, although a statement from AQA denied this.
Duffy countered the removal with a poem highlighting violence in other fiction such as Shakespeare's plays, called 'Mrs Schofield's GCSE'.
Poet Laureate
Duffy was almost appointed Poet Laureate in 1999 (after the death of previous Laureate Ted Hughes), but lost out on the position to Andrew Motion.
According to the Sunday Times Downing Street sources stated unofficially that Prime Minister Tony Blair was "worried about having a homosexual poet laureate because of how it might play in middle England".
Duffy later claimed that she would not have accepted the laureateship anyway, saying in an interview with the Guardian newspaper that "I will not write a poem for Edward and Sophie.
No self-respecting poet should have to".
She says she regards Andrew Motion as a friend and that the idea of a contest between them for the post was entirely invented by the newspapers.
"I genuinely don't think she even wanted to be poet laureate," said Peter Jay, Duffy's former publisher.
"The post can be a poisoned chalice.
It is not a role I would wish on anyone – particularly not someone as forthright and uncompromising as Carol Ann".
The Guardian has also stated that Duffy  was reluctant to take up the role in 1999 as she was in a relationship at the time, and had a young daughter, so was reluctant to take up a position which would have put her so prominently in the public eye.
Nevertheless, she was finally appointed to the position in May 2009, as successor to Andrew Motion.
Other works
Duffy is also a playwright, and has had plays performed at the Liverpool Playhouse and the Almeida Theatre in London.
Her plays include Take My Husband (1982), Cavern of Dreams (1984), Little Women, Big Boys (1986) Loss (1986), Casanova (2007).
Her radio credits include an adaptation of Rapture.
Her children's collections include Meeting Midnight (1999) and The Oldest Girl in the World (2000).
She also collaborated with Manchester composer, Sasha Johnson Manning on The Manchester Carols - a series of Christmas songs that premiered in Manchester Cathedral in 2007.
