The Rio de Janeiro bid for the 2016 Summer Olympics and Paralympics was a successful campaign, first recognised by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) on September 14, 2007.
On June 4, 2008, the IOC Executive Board shortlisted Rio de Janeiro with three of the six other applicant cities—Chicago, United States; Madrid, Spain; and Tokyo, Japan; over Baku, Azerbaijan; Doha, Qatar; and Prague, Czech Republic—during a meeting in Athens, Greece, after a detailed study of the Applicant Files received by the IOC Working Group on January 14, 2008.
The Brazilian Olympic Committee (BOC) chose Rio de Janeiro as its candidate city to host the 2016 Summer Olympics and Paralympics, during its Annual Assembly on September 1, 2006.
This bid is the city's first that has proceeded to the Candidature phase, after three failed attempts for 1936, 2004, and 2012.
The city country, Brazil will be the fourth country to host the Olympics and the World Cup in proximate years.
The IOC Evaluation Commission, led by Nawal El Moutawakel, arrived in Rio de Janeiro on April 27, 2009, to assess the conditions of the candidature.
Between April 29 and May 2, the Commission attended technical presentations, participated in question-and-answer sessions about the Candidature File and made inspections in all the existing venues across the city.
The lengthy and intensive bidding process was concluded with the election of Rio de Janeiro as the host city during the 121st IOC Session, held in Copenhagen, Denmark, on October 2, 2009.
Rio de Janeiro is planning to hold all the competitions inside the city as was done in the XV Pan American Games.
There will be seven competition clusters—Barra, Copacabana, Deodoro, Flamengo, João Havelange, Lagoa and Maracanã—in four Olympic zones—Barra, Copacabana, Deodoro, and Maracanã.
Football matches will be held in the cities of Belo Horizonte, Brasília, Salvador and São Paulo.
The proposed dates range from August 5 to 21 for the Summer Olympics, and September 7 (Independence Day of Brazil) to 18 for the Summer Paralympics.

Candidature process
Rio de Janeiro's bidding process began on July 28, 2006, when the Executive Council of the Brazilian Olympic Committee (BOC) met to consider the possibility of nominating a Brazilian city to host the 2016 Summer Olympics and Paralympics.
This meeting was prompted by the fact that several cities in the world had already demonstrated an early interest around the election, some having already announced their bidding intention.
On September 1, 2006, the BOC's Annual Assembly decided unanimously that Rio de Janeiro would be the Brazilian representative seeking to host the 2016 Summer Olympics and Paralympics, winning out over São Paulo.
The Assembly felt it was the only city in Brazil and Latin America which would possess Olympic-level facilities ready for an Olympic bid, having hosted the XV Pan American Games in 2007.
Another positive aspect was that Rio de Janeiro could host all the Olympic sports, excluding football (soccer), within the city limits.
The Brazilian government immediately expressed its full support to a bid from Rio de Janeiro.
The BOC president, Carlos Arthur Nuzman, and then mayor of Rio de Janeiro, César Maia, approved the decision, thus making Rio the official Brazilian candidate for the 2016 Summer Olympics and Paralympics bidding campaign.
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) launched the bidding process for the 2016 Summer Olympics and Paralympics on May 16, 2007.
All then 203 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) were invited to submit the name of a city within their jurisdiction to host the Games, and had until September 13, 2007, to notify the IOC of such intention.
On September 14, 2007, the IOC announced that seven cities—Baku, Chicago, Doha, Madrid, Prague, Rio de Janeiro, and Tokyo—from three different Associations of National Olympic Committees (ANOCs), had been put forward by their respective NOCs for the 2016 Summer Olympics and Paralympics.
The Rio de Janeiro bid committee attended the 2016 Applicant Cities' Seminar in Lausanne, Switzerland, on October 18, 2007, where it learnt more about the bidding process.
The seven applicant cities returned their Application Files to the IOC on January 14, 2008.
The Application Files, which contain the answers and guarantees requested by the IOC's 2016 Candidature Acceptance Procedure and Questionnaire, provide the IOC with an overview of each applicant city's project.
The responses were studied by the IOC Working Group and the IOC Executive Board, at the latter meeting to decide which cities would be accepted as candidate cities.
The IOC announced that Chicago, Tokyo, Rio de Janeiro, and Madrid had made it onto the final shortlist, during a June 4, 2008 meeting in Athens, Greece.
This decision was based on a report by a special IOC Working Group of experts, after a thorough technical analysis of the projects presented on the files submitted by the applicant cities.
This group assessed each city's potential for staging successful Summer Olympics and Paralympics in 2016, according to eleven criteria: government support, legal issues and public opinion; general infrastructure; sport venues; Olympic village; environment conditions and impact; accommodation; transport concept; safety and security; experience from past sport events; finance; and overall project and legacy.
Between August 5 and August 26, 2008, the bidding committees from the four candidate cities participated in the Olympic Games Observer Program, during the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China.
On February 12, 2009, the IOC announced that it had received the Candidature Files of the four candidates.
Seven days later, the Candidature File was also delivered to the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) in Bonn, Germany.
The Rio de Janeiro 2016 Candidate File has three volumes containing 568 pages of detailed answers to 300 technical questions, divided into 17 themes.
The city of Copenhagen was chosen to stage the 13th Olympic Congress, together with the meetings of the Executive Board and the 121st IOC Session on October 2, 2009.
The capital of Denmark was picked over Athens, Busan, Cairo, Riga, Singapore and Taipei, on February 8, 2006, during the 118th IOC Session held in Turin, Italy.
The last day of the Olympic campaign began with the opening of the 121st IOC Session at the Copenhagen's Bella Center.
Each city made its final presentation in the order of drawing of lots (Chicago, Tokyo, Rio de Janeiro, Madrid) as performed by the IOC Executive Board in 2007.
The cities had 45 minutes to make a presentation to the Session, followed by 15 minutes for questions.
Following the presentations by the cities, Nawal El Moutawakel presented the report of the Evaluation Commission to the Session.
Chicago fell in the first round, followed by Tokyo, after the eligible IOC members have been asked to vote.
In the final round, Rio de Janeiro was elected with a large majority of the votes over Madrid (66 to 32).
The announcement of the winning city was communicated by Jacques Rogge at the announcement ceremony, following which, the BOC and Rio de Janeiro signed the Host City Contract.
The entire procedure leading to the election of Rio de Janeiro as the host city for the 2016 Summer Olympics was governed by the Olympic Charter.
Candidature details
Rio de Janeiro bid for the 1936, 2004 and 2012 Summer Olympics, but failed on every occasion, and missed the shortlist in the last two attempts.
On March 14, 2008, the IOC's 2016 Working Group released its evaluation report.
Through analysis of the Applicant Files, the IOC gave a weighted-average score to each bid—Tokyo scored 8.3, Madrid 8.1, Chicago 7.0, Doha 6.9, Rio de Janeiro 6.4, Prague 5.3, and Baku 4.3—based on the scores obtained in each of the questionnaire's eleven themes.
According to the Working Group, the minimum required grade was benchmarked at 6; being closer to 0 considered to be unsatisfactory, closer to 10 to be satisfactory and around 5 to be average.
Rio de Janeiro had its highest score in the Government support, legal issues and public opinion theme and its lowest in the Safety and security theme.
The IOC's decision to select Rio de Janeiro over Doha generated criticism, as the Doha bid committee accused the IOC of "closing the door on the Arab world" and of making a political decision rather than judging on technical grounds.
Doha outperformed Rio de Janeiro in the majority of the categories assessed by the IOC, but according to the IOC, Doha's desire to stage the Summer Olympics in October, rather than the traditional mid-summer time frame, because of high temperatures was the reason the bid was rejected.
On September 18, 2008, the IOC announced the composition of the Evaluation Commission which would inspect the four candidate cities.
The Commission, composed of representatives from the Olympic Movement and advisors, was led by Nawal El Moutawakel, who had also chaired the Evaluation Commission for the 2012 Summer Olympics bid process.
On April 27, 2009, the IOC Evaluation Commission arrived in Rio de Janeiro to assess the conditions of the candidature.
According to IOC members and with Madrid yet to visit, the welcoming activities prepared by the city had been the best.
During the first two days, the Commission held internal meetings at the Copacabana Palace, the host hotel.
Between April 29 and 30, the Commission attended technical presentations and participated in question-and-answer sessions on each of the seventeen themes presented in the Candidature File.
The last two days were marked by the inspectors' visit to all the existing venues across the city.
After seven days of inspections involving 300 professionals, the thirteen members of the IOC Evaluation Commission—of which seven have voting rights—left Rio de Janeiro on the way to Madrid, on May 3, 2009.
According to Moutawakel, the Commission was very impressed with the level of integration of the Games in the country's long-term development plan.
On May 4, 2009, the Rio de Janeiro bid committee accused the Madrid bid committee of sending a spy to Rio de Janeiro during the visit of the inspection commission, and considered filing a formal ethics complaint with the IOC.
According to the Madrid bid committee, accusations it spied on a rival candidate had been blown out of proportion.
The IOC Evaluation Commission analysed the Candidature Files and performed on-site inspections in Chicago (April 2–7), Tokyo (April 14–19), Rio de Janeiro (April 27 – May 2), and Madrid (May 4–9).
It then released a comprehensive technical appraisal for the IOC members, one month before the host city election on October 2, 2009, in Copenhagen, Denmark.
The IOC Executive Board then draws up the candidate cities to be submitted for the final vote by the IOC Session.
The procedure leading to the election of the host city for the Olympic and Paralympic Games is governed by the Olympic Charter.
The election takes place in a country which does not have a candidate for the Games in question.
Copenhagen was chosen to stage the 13th Olympic Congress, together with the meetings of the Executive Board and the 121st IOC Session, on February 8, 2006, during the 118th IOC Session held in Turin, Italy.
The capital of Denmark was picked over Athens, Busan, Cairo, Riga, Singapore and Taipei.
Candidature concept
According to the Rio de Janeiro 2016 bid committee, the bid's concept is based on four principles—technical excellence, experience of a lifetime, transformation, and supporting the Olympic and Paralympic Movements.
The first principle, called "Technical excellence", includes aspects such as the Games plan, Olympic and Paralympic villages, accommodation, transport, security and financial certainty.
From these items, the most controversial is the security, previously criticised for its numerous failures.
The second principle, "Experience of a lifetime", comprises client partnerships, filled stadiums, and sport presentation.
The third principle, "Transformation", mixes environmental and social issues, such as the regeneration of the port region, sustainability and social inclusion.
The Summer Olympics and Paralympics will embed the Games in society, through programs for job generation, education, community outreach, volunteerism, training and up-skilling initiatives.
The last principle, "Supporting the Olympic and Paralympic Movements", combines the expansion interests of the Olympic and Paralympic Movements.
Using the Olympics Live initiative and the powerful influence of Brazil in South America, the Rio de Janeiro 2016 bid committee hopes to impact a new audience for the Olympic and Paralympic brands, supporting the IOC's strategy.
The visual identity of the Rio de Janeiro candidature consists of a logo and a slogan, which are being applied in marketing moves during the campaign.
Designed by Ana Soter and selected among four finalists by a special jury, the logo was unveiled during the 2007 Brazilian Olympic Awards, held at the Municipal Theater of Rio de Janeiro, on December 17, 2007.
The Sugarloaf Mountain was chosen as the symbol, representing the natural richness of Rio de Janeiro.
According to the Rio de Janeiro 2016 bid committee, the design as a whole conveys a heart shape, representing Brazilian passion and enthusiasm for sports.
Through its mirroring effect, the symbol also forms a stylized clover.
At midnight on January 1, 2009, Rio de Janeiro's Olympic slogan "Live your passion" was launched as part of the New Year's celebrations.
The slogan reflects the Brazilian people's way of getting passionately involved in whatever they do.
It was projected onto a Rio de Janeiro 2016-themed big wheel immediately after the ten-second countdown to the beginning of 2009.
The structure, purposedly erected at the Copacabana beach to promote the candidature, is   high, weighs   and has 24 gondolas with a capacity for 144 people.
Approximately two million people attended the official launch of Rio de Janeiro's bid slogan.
Rio de Janeiro has previously hosted major sporting, business and cultural events.
On the sporting front, these events have included World Cups and World Championships in many Olympic sports, and regional championships.
From July 13 to July 29, 2007, the city successfully staged the XV and largest ever edition of the Pan American Games (over 5,650 athletes competing in 34 sports) and the accompanying Parapan American Games (over 1,150 athletes competing in 10 sports).
Rio de Janeiro hosted the 1950 FIFA World Cup and is going to host the 2014 FIFA World Cup, two years before the 2016 Summer Olympics and Paralympics, which includes upgrades to security, telecommunications, and tourism infrastructure.
The 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup will be organised by Brazil and used as a test event for the 2014 FIFA World Cup.
The proposed competition schedule spreads medals across the entire program, with two peaks at the weekends to coincide with prime-time for spectators and television viewers.
The period proposed by the Rio de Janeiro bid team to stage the 2016 Summer Olympics is from Friday, August 5, to Sunday, August 21, 2016.
It is also proposed that the 2016 Summer Paralympics begin seventeen days after the Olympics Closing Ceremony, on Wednesday, September 7, and last until Sunday, September 18.
Politics
Rio de Janeiro has full political backing and strong popular support.
The Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (OCOG) will be the legal entity responsible for planning and staging the 2016 Summer Olympics and Paralympics.
The bid committee is under the leadership of an Honorary Council and an Executive Board.
The Honorary Council comprises the President of the Federative Republic of Brazil, the Governor of the State of Rio de Janeiro, the Mayor of the Municipality of Rio de Janeiro, and the two Brazilian IOC members, Carlos Arthur Nuzman and João Havelange.
Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Sérgio Cabral Filho and Eduardo Paes signed the guarantees and covenants required by the IOC, as well as some additional undertakings.
The Executive Board is chaired by Carlos Arthur Nuzman and Carlos Roberto Osório, President General and Secretary General, respectively, of the bid committee and BOC.
Rio de Janeiro's government and all major political parties of Brazil have endorsed and pledged complete support for Rio de Janeiro's candidature and, ultimately, the conduct of the Games in Brazil.
The candidature includes support from international federations and organizations.
The Brazilian President also formed a Federal government Inter-Ministerial Committee, under the patronage of the Minister of Sport, Orlando Silva.
The Ministry of External Relations and the Ministry of Labor guaranteed the entry, exit and working arrangements for Games personnel.
People in possession of a valid passport and an Olympic or Paralympic Identity and Accreditation Card, in lieu of a visa, will be able to enter the Brazilian territory.
Brazilian President Lula has compared the potential of an Olympics in Rio to the revolutionary Che Guevara’s youthful tour of South America, depicted in the movie The Motorcycle Diaries, remarking "imagine how many Latin Americans would come here by bicycle, on foot, by riverboat, by bus, by plane, in ways you cannot imagine".
Finance
The three levels of Brazilian government have guaranteed the free provision of a range of services to the bid, including security, medical services, customs, transport, immigration, and other governmental services and support.
Rio de Janeiro has already approved funding of US$240 billion from the Program for Growth Acceleration (PAC).
Other revenue-generating activities include sponsorship sales, ticketing program, licensing and merchandising.
These revenues will be supplemented by IOC-secured commercial and broadcast contributions.
Capital expenditure on infrastructure by the government or the private sector includes already committed and ongoing investments of US$3.9 billion on projects such as airport and subway expansions and construction of the metropolitan road arc.
The OCOG budget does not assume any capital contributions to the construction of permanent or legacy venues, other than for Games overlay, including the construction of temporary venues.
The balance of OCOG expenditures will be funded by the public sector, involving a combination of government commitments from Federal, State and Municipal levels.
The OCOG budget and operating expenses are projected at US$2.8 billion, with its Olympic-related budget, including capital investments in transportation, sports venues and incremental costs being US$11.6 billion.
The bid budget for the Applicant and Candidature phases is projected at US$42 million.
The Presidency of the Republic submitted guarantees to cover any potential shortfall in the OCOG budget, supported by the state government and local municipality.
Infrastructure
Rio de Janeiro's infrastructure, systems, management structures and staff readiness will be tested thoroughly during the 2014 FIFA World Cup, as well as during dedicated transport test events in 2015.
There will be 49,750 rooms to meet IOC requirements, of which some 1,700 are located in apartment hotels in the city and more than 13,000 in hotels throughout Rio de Janeiro and the football tournament host cities.
Rio de Janeiro proposes to use cruise ships and condominium apartments to overcome a possible shortage in the number of hotel rooms.
Six modern cruise ships will provide more than 8,500 cabins.
Media would be accommodated in a combination of media villages and hotels.
Rio de Janeiro plans to implement   of Olympic lanes connecting the four Olympic zones and the Antônio Carlos Jobim International Airport.
An existing corridor of high-capacity rail and metro systems as well as motorways and major roads links three of the four Olympic zones, and with the development of the western corridor, all four zones will be connected.
Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system is going to be the main solution to the city's topography.
Security and disaster-related risks for the event will be mitigated by the implementation of a comprehensive security operation.
Crime in parts of Rio de Janeiro was considered to be an issue for the safety of people attending the Games.
Rio de Janeiro's experience in mounting security structures around highly mediatized and crowd-attracting events is a positive aspect.
The Federal Government will be responsible for the security of the 2016 Summer Olympics and Paralympics.
Candidature project
Rio de Janeiro proposes to hold all sporting events within the city limits—apart from the football (soccer) tournaments which would be held in the cities of Belo Horizonte, Brasília, Salvador and São Paulo—making the Games more compact and technically feasible.
The competition venues will be located in four Olympic zones—Barra, Copacabana, Deodoro, and Maracanã—and divided in seven Olympic clusters—Barra, Copacabana, Deodoro, Flamengo, João Havelange, Lagoa and Maracanã—with four Olympic precincts—Maracanã, Olympic Park, Riocentro and X Park.
The Olympic and Paralympic Village, the International Broadcast Centre (IBC) and the Main Press Centre (MPC) will be located at the Barra zone, which is the core of the project and includes the largest number of competition venues.
A television tower will be built at the IBC/MPC complex to complement broadcasting operations and provide panoramic studios.
There will be a media-exclusive hotel within the complex, accessible directly from the IBC/MPC.
The Olympic and Paralympic Village complex will include an Olympic Village Training Center, an Olympic Village Park, an Olympic Beach and direct access to the Olympic Park, in addition to the 8,856 rooms to accommodate over 17,770 athletes and team officials, including accredited additional officials.
Rio de Janeiro's competition venues meet the International Federation's (IFs) technical requirements and both IOC and IPC standards, and align with the City Master Plan and legacy strategy.
Most venues are already operational, recently developed or renovated.
According to the Rio de Janeiro 2016 bid committee, there are ten (29%) existing venues with no permanent works required and eight (24%) venues requiring reforms, while nine (26%) new permanent venues and seven (21%) temporary venues will be built.
In total there will be 34 competition venues alongside 29 training venues, as part of the training venues strategy.
The most significant legacy project from the bid is the Olympic Training Center (OTC) program and facilities with its headquarters located in Barra zone.
Furthermore, the Rio de Janeiro 2016 bid committee recognizes the possibility of new sports being added to the Olympic Program and, following detailed analysis for each of the seven potential sports—baseball, golf, karate, roller sports, rugby, softball and squash—confirms its capability to accommodate any of them in respect to venues, transport and other operational or logistical aspects.
In addition, Rio de Janeiro and the four proposed cities to hold football (soccer) competitions—Brasília, Belo Horizonte, Salvador and São Paulo—were chosen to host the 2014 FIFA World Cup.
Rio de Janeiro will build the Summer Paralympics, upon the experience of hosting the III Parapan American Games—considered "the best ever" by the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) and the Americas Paralympic Committee (APC)—as well as many other international competitions for athletes with disabilities.
For this purpose, the organizing committee will include representatives of the Brazilian Paralympic Committee (BPC) and create a specific department responsible for supervising the Games.
Another element that will bring the Paralympics up to par with their Olympic counterpart is the reuse of twenty Olympic competition venues for the equivalent Paralympic sports.
Promotion of accessibility-friendly measures by the hospitality and tourism industries will also be encouraged and recognized by the government.
Athletes will enjoy good climatic conditions in Rio de Janeiro, where mild southern hemisphere winter provides optimal environment for athletic performance.
Warm days, cool nights and the absence of heavy rainfall combine to produce a favorable atmosphere for spectators.
Average midday temperature of   is predicted during the proposed dates for the Summer Olympics, with temperatures ranging from   to   and humidity levels of 66.4%.
