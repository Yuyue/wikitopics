The family of Barack Obama is an extended family of African American, English, Indonesian, and Kenyan (Luo) heritage known through the writings and political career of Barack Obama, the President of the United States of America.
His immediate family is the First Family of the United States.
The Obamas are the first First Family of African American descent in United States and the youngest to enter the White House since the Kennedys.
One columnist wrote, “Obama's young, energetic family harks back to days of Camelot.”
Immediate family
Michelle Obama
Michelle Obama, née Robinson, the wife of Barack Obama, was born on January 17, 1964 in Chicago, Illinois.
She is a lawyer and was a University of Chicago Hospital Vice-President.
She is the First Lady of the United States.
Malia Obama and Sasha Obama
Barack and Michelle Obama have two daughters, Malia Ann,  , and Sasha,  .
Malia ( ) was born July 4, 1998 and Natasha (known as Sasha,  ) was born June 10, 2001.
Sasha is the youngest resident of the White House since John F. Kennedy, Jr. arrived as an infant in 1961.
Sasha is also the youngest child of a President in office since Patrick Bouvier Kennedy.
Before his inauguration, President Obama published an open letter to his daughters in Parade magazine, describing what he wants for them and every child in America: He wrote that he wanted them "to grow up in a world with no limits on your dreams and no achievements beyond your reach, and to grow into compassionate, committed women who will help build that world".
They keep busy schedules, as the Associated Press reports: "soccer, dance and drama for Malia, gymnastics and tap for Sasha, piano and tennis for both".
They both gave an interview to the television series, Access Hollywood, which President Obama regretted allowing.
In his victory speech on the night of his election, President Obama promised Sasha and Malia a puppy to take with them to the White House.
The selection of a dog was complicated by the fact that Malia is allergic to animal dander.
According to President Obama, the choice has been narrowed down to either a labradoodle or Portuguese Water Dog.
It was announced on November 21, 2008 that Sasha and Malia will be attending the private Sidwell Friends School in Washington, DC, the same school as attended by Chelsea Clinton, Tricia Nixon Cox, and Archibald Roosevelt.
They began classes there on January 5, 2009.
While in Chicago, both attended the private University of Chicago Laboratory School.
Sidwell is also where the grandchildren of Joe Biden attend school.

In January 2009 it was reported that Robinson will officially be moving into the White House itself and becoming part of the First Family; she will be the first live-in grandmother there since Elvira "Minnie " Doud during the Eisenhower administration.
Some media outlets have dubbed Robinson the "First Granny".
Extended family - maternal relations
According to Barack Obama's Dreams from My Father, his great-grandmother Leona McCurry was part Native American, which Obama believed Leona held as a "source of considerable shame" and "blanched whenever someone mentioned the subject and hoped to carry the secret to her grave"; whereas McCurry's daughter (Obama's maternal grandmother) "would turn her head in profile to show off her beaked nose, which along with a pair of jet-black eyes, was offered as proof of Cherokee blood".
To date, no concrete evidence has surfaced of Cherokee heritage.
Obama's maternal heritage consists mostly of English ancestry, with much smaller amounts of German, Irish, Scottish, Welsh, Swiss, and French ancestry.

Barack Obama's paternal grandfather (c. 1895–1979); he worked as a mission cook.
He joined the British Army during World War I.
(One source gives 1870–1975 as his dates of birth and death based on his tombstone reading "Mzee Hussein Onyango Obama" in his home village.
The term "mzee" is a Kenyan honorific meaning "old man" or "elder".
)  According to his third wife, Sarah, he originally was a Roman Catholic, but took the name Hussein when he converted to Islam; she said he passed the name, not the religion, on to his children.
Habiba Akumu Obama

Although not a blood relation, Barack Obama nevertheless calls her "Granny Sarah".
Sarah, who speaks Luo and only a few words of English, communicates with President Obama through an interpreter.
On July 4, 2008, she attended the United States Independence Day celebrations in Nairobi, hosted by Michael Ranneberger, the US ambassador in Kenya.
During the campaign she protested attempts to portray Obama as a foreigner to the United States or a Muslim, saying that while Obama's grandfather had been a Muslim, "In the world of today, children have different religions from their parents".

He met his half-brother for the first time in 1985 when Barack flew from Chicago to Washington, D.C. to visit him.
Malik and his half-brother Barack were best men at each other's weddings.
Barack Obama brought his wife Michelle to Kenya three years later, and they met with Malik again while Barack was introducing Michelle to many other new relatives.
Although much of the Obama family has dispersed throughout Kenya and overseas, most, including Malik Obama, still considered their rural village on the shores of Lake Victoria to be their true home, and feel that those who have left the village have become culturally "lost".
A frequent visitor to the United States, and consultant in Washington, D.C. for several months per year, he nevertheless settled in the Obamas' ancestral home, Nyang’oma Kogelo, a village of several hundred people that he prefers to the city for its slow pace.
He runs a small electronics shop a half hour drive outside of town.

George Hussein Onyango Obama
Youngest half-brother of Barack Obama, born c.1982, son of Barack Obama Sr. and a woman named Jael (now a resident of Atlanta, Georgia).
George was six months old when his father died in an automobile accident, after which he was raised in Nairobi by his mother and a French step-father.
He later lived in South Korea for two years while his mother resided there for business reasons.
Returning to Kenya, George Obama "slept rough for several years," until his aunt gave him a six-by-eight foot corrugated metal shack in the Nairobi, Kenya, slum of Huruma Flats.
As of August 2008, Obama was studying to become a mechanic.
George received little attention until being featured in an article in the Italian language edition of Vanity Fair in August 2008, which portrayed him as living in poverty, shame, and obscurity.
The article quoted Obama as saying that he lived "on less than a dollar a month" and stated that he "does not mention his famous half-brother in conversation" out of shame at his poverty.
In later interviews George contradicted this picture.
In an interview with The Times, Obama "said that he was furious at subsequent reports that he had been abandoned by the Obama family and that he was filled with shame about living in a slum".
He told The Times, "Life in Huruma is good".
Obama said that he expects no favors, that he was supported by relatives, and that reports he lived on a dollar a month were "all lies by people who don’t want my brother to win.”  He told The Telegraph that he was inspired by his half-brother.
According to Time, George "has repeatedly denied...that he feels abandoned by Obama".
CNN quoted him as saying, "I was brought up well.
I live well even now.
The magazines, they have exaggerated everything...
I think I kind of like it here.
There are some challenges, but maybe it is just like where you come from, there are the same challenges".
George's reported poverty was seized on by conservative critics of Barack Obama.
Columnist Dinesh D'Souza solicited donations for George Obama from his readers, while Jerome Corsi planned to give him a $1,000 check during a trip to Kenya (Corsi was expelled from the country by immigration authorities).
Omar Obama
Half-uncle of Barack Obama, born on June 3, 1944 in Nyang’oma Kogelo.
Oldest son of Onyango and Sarah Obama, resides in Boston, Massachusetts.
Zeituni Onyango
Half-sister of Barack Obama Sr., born May 29, 1952, in Kenya, Onyango is referred to as "Aunti Zeituni" in President Obama's memoir, Dreams from My Father.
Barack Obama first met Onyango in 1988 during his first trip to Kenya.
She worked as a computer programmer at Kenya Breweries in Nairobi during that period.
Onyango suffers from a physical disability and uses a walking stick.
She claims to have visited the United States multiple times since 1975, and to have returned to Kenya each time.
By 2008, Onyango had been living quietly in a South Boston public housing project, according to Boston Public Housing Authority officials.
William McGonigle, deputy director of the Authority, called Onyango a "delightful lady" and "a great resident" who did a "wonderful job" as a public health advocate.
He commented that Onyango was "not looking for fame or notoriety, and we were as surprised as anyone to learn she was related to the Democratic nominee".
Onyango worked as a volunteer computer systems co-ordinator for the Experience Corps, a program in which adults over 55 mentor children in their communities.
Onyango became the subject of media attention in the final week of the 2008 US presidential election in which Barack Obama was the Democratic candidate.
The impetus for the scrutiny was an article by the Associated Press, based on anonymous government sources, which reported that Onyango was living in the United States without valid immigration status, after being asked to leave the country when her request for asylum was denied.
Onyango's case resulted in a special nationwide directive within Immigrations and Customs Enforcement requiring any deportations to be approved at the level of ICE regional directors before the US presidential election and led to an investigation by the Federal government to determine the source of the leaked information and whether any laws were broken by federal officials in the Bush administration or in the McCain campaign in disclosing information about her immigration status.
Federal Election Commission records show that Onyango donated multiple times to her half-nephew's campaign; the records compiled by The Huffington Post show she gave a total of $260 to the campaign.
Since it is illegal for foreign citizens and immigrants without  green cards to make political donations, the Obama campaign announced their intention to return the money.
Yusuf Obama
Half-uncle of Barack Obama, born c. 1950s in Nyang’oma Kogelo; son of Onyango and Sarah Obama.
Said Obama
Half-uncle of Barack Obama, born c. 1950s in Nyang’oma Kogelo; son of Onyango and Sarah Obama.
Michelle Robinson Obama's extended family
Barack Obama has called his wife Michelle "the most quintessentially American woman I know".
Her family is of African American heritage, descendents of Africans of the American Colonial Era.
Michelle Obama's family history traces back from slavery to Reconstruction to the Great Migration North.
Some of Michelle's relatives still reside in South Carolina.
Michelle's earliest known relative is her great-great grandfather Jim Robinson, born in the 1850s, who was an American slave on the Friendfield plantation in South Carolina.
The family believes that after the Civil War he remained a Friendfield plantation sharecropper for the rest of his life and that he was buried there in an unmarked grave.
Jim had two sons, Gabriel and Fraser, Michelle Obama's great-grandfather.
Fraser had an arm amputated as a result of a boyhood injury.
He worked as a shoemaker, newspaper salesman and in a lumber mill and was married to Rosella Cohen.
Carrie Nelson, Gabriel Robinson's daughter, now 80, is the oldest living Robinson and the keeper of family lore.
At least three of Michelle Obama's great-uncles served honorably in the military of the United States.
One aunt moved to Princeton, New Jersey, where she worked as a maid, and cooked Southern-style meals for Michelle and her brother, Craig, when they were students at Princeton University.
Craig Robinson

Fraser Robinson, Jr.
Michelle Obama's grandfather was born on August 24, 1912 in Georgetown, South Carolina, and died on November 9, 1996, aged 84.
He was a good student and orator, but moved from South Carolina to Chicago to find better work than he could find at home, eventually becoming a worker for the United States Postal Service.
He was married to LaVaughn Johnson.
When he retired, they moved back to South Carolina.
Capers C. Funnye Jr.
Michelle Obama's first cousin once removed: Funnye’s mother, Verdelle Robinson Funnye (born Verdelle Robinson; August 22, 1930 – April 16, 2000) and Michelle Obama’s paternal grandfather, Fraser Robinson Jr., were siblings.
One of America's most prominent African American Jews, known for acting as a bridge between mainstream Jewry and African Americans.
Genealogical charts
Obama–Dunham–Payne ancestries
Family trees
Distant relations
According to genealogists, Barack Obama's distant cousins include the multitude of descendants of his maternal ancestors from all along the early-American Atlantic seaboard as well as paternal, Kenyan relations belonging to the Luo tribe, many descending from a 17th century ancestor named Owiny.
For example, George W. Bush, the 43rd U.S. president, is the eleventh cousin of Barack Obama.
The New York Times science writer Nicholas Wade argues that with eleven generations leading back to their common progenitor, Samuel Hinckley, the relationship between the 43rd President and the 44th President is "genetically meaningless".
