Backlash (2009) is an upcoming professional wrestling pay-per-view event produced by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), which will take place on April 26, 2009 at the Dunkin' Donuts Center in Providence, Rhode Island.
It will feature talent from all three WWE brands: Raw, SmackDown, and ECW.
There are currently four matches on the event's card.
Background
Backlash will feature professional wrestling matches that involve different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds, plots, and storylines that will be played out on Raw, Friday Night SmackDown, ECW on Sci Fi, and Superstars—World Wrestling Entertainment's (WWE) television programs.
Wrestlers will portray a villain or a hero as they follow a series of events that build tension, and culminate into a wrestling match or series of matches.
The event will feature wrestlers from WWE's Raw, SmackDown, and ECW brands—a storyline division in which WWE employees are assigned to a television program of the same name.
The main rivalry heading into Backlash is between Triple H and Randy Orton over the WWE Championship.
The feud started back in February when Orton attacked Triple H's wife Stephanie McMahon.
Then Triple H convinced Orton to challenge him at WrestleMania XXV, which Orton accepted.
At WrestleMania, Triple H defeated Orton to retain the championship.
The following night on Raw, WWE chairman Vince McMahon announced that there will be a Six-Man Tag Team match at Backlash between Triple H, Shane McMahon and himself against the Legacy (Orton, Ted DiBiase and Cody Rhodes) which was then turned into a WWE Championship match by new General Manager of Raw, Vickie Guerrero later on.
Shane and Triple H were attacked later that night by the Legacy, but were then saved by a returning Batista.
Vince then announced that Batista will take his place at Backlash.
Another rivalry heading into Backlash is between John Cena and Edge over the World Heavyweight Championship.
At WWE's February pay-per-view event, No Way Out, Edge attacked Kofi Kingston, who was due to compete in an Elimination Chamber match for Cena's World Heavyweight Championship, took his spot in the match, and won the title.
At WrestleMania XXV, Cena defeated the defending champion Edge and The Big Show in a Triple Threat match to win the championship back.
Then, on the April 6 episode of Raw, Vickie Guerrero announced that Cena would defend his World Heavyweight Championship against Edge in a Last Man Standing match at Backlash.
It was announced on the April 7 edition of ECW on Sci Fi by interim General manager Tiffany that Jack Swagger (Jake Hager) will defend his ECW Championship against the winner of the currently-running "elimination chase", which commenced on that night featuring Christian (William Reso), Tommy Dreamer, Finlay (Dave Finlay), and Mark Henry; the participants in the chase would have a four-way on that night, which saw Henry being pinned, which meant his elimination from contention with the remaining three wrestlers competing in a Triple Threat match on the April 14 episode of ECW on Sci Fi with the person being pinned or forced to submit being eliminated from contention; Dreamer was pinned in this contest, leading to a singles match between Finlay and Christian on the April 16 episode of Superstars, which saw Christian get the victory, thus allowing him to face Swagger for the title at Backlash.
After Matt Hardy defeated his brother, Jeff Hardy, at WrestleMania XXV, he had vowed to "erase Jeff from the WWE", thus leading to a stretcher match between the two, also won by Matt.
The following Monday, Matt was drafted to Raw, but said he would still end the feud with his brother after multiple attacks from Jeff unto him, and on the April 17 edition of SmackDown, general manager, Theodore Long, announced an "I Quit" match between the two.
