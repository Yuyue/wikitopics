Venkatraman "Venki" Ramakrishnan (வெங்கட்ராமன் ராமகிருஷ்ணன்; born 1952 in Chidambaram, Tamil Nadu, India) is a structural biologist at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, England.
He is best known for his work on the structure and function of the ribosome.
Early life
Venkatraman Ramakrishnan was born in Chidambaram in Cuddalore district of Tamil Nadu, India.
He moved to Baroda (Vadodara) in Gujarat state at the age of three, where he had his schooling, except for spending 1960-61 in Adelaide, Australia.
He did his pre-science as well as his B.Sc.
in Physics from Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda, India, in 1971 and then his Ph.D. in Physics from Ohio University in 1976.
He then spent two years studying biology as a graduate student at the University of California, San Diego while making a transition from theoretical physics to biology.
Career
Background and research work
Ramakrishnan first began work on ribosomes as a postdoctoral fellow with Peter Moore at Yale..
He continued to work on ribosomes as a staff scieintist at Brookhaven National Laboratory.
In 1995 he  moved to the University of Utah as a Professor of Biochemistry, and in 1999, he moved to his current position at the Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, England.
In 1999, Ramakrishnan's laboratory published a 5.5 Angstrom resolution structure of the 30S subunit.
The following year, his laboratory determined the complete atomic structure of the 30S subunit of the ribosome and its complexes with several antibiotics.
This was followed by studies that provided structural insights into the mechanism that ensures the fidelity of protein biosynthesis.
More recently, his laboratory has determined the atomic structure of the whole ribosome in complex with its tRNA and mRNA ligands.
Ramakrishnan is also known for his past work on histone and chromatin structure.
Honours
Ramakrishnan is a Fellow of the Royal Society, a member of EMBO and the U.S. National Academy of Sciences and a Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge.
He was awarded the 2007 Louis-Jeantet Prize for Medicine, and the Heatley Medal of the British Biochemical Society.
In 2009, Ramakrishnan was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry along with Thomas A. Steitz and Ada Yonath.
