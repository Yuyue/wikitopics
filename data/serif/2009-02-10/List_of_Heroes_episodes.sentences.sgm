The NBC science fiction serial drama series Heroes follows the lives of people across the globe who possess various superhuman powers as they struggle to cope with their everyday lives and prevent foreseen disasters from occurring.
The series premiered on American and Canadian television on September 25, 2006.
The first season, which finished 21st of 142 American primetime television programs in Nielsen Ratings, was released on DVD and HD DVD on August 28, 2007.
The second season ranked 21st of 220 in the ratings, and was released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc on August 26, 2008 with the Blu-ray release of the first season.
Within the seasons of Heroes are "volumes", which allow the writers to focus on shorter story arcs.
The first season comprises a single volume of 23 episodes called Genesis, which is also the title of the pilot episode.
The second season was designed to contain three volumes called Generations, Exodus, and Villains: Exodus was scrapped due to viewer criticism and the 2007â€“2008 Writers Guild of America strike; and Villains was carried over to the show's third season.
As a result, the second season consisted of only 11 episodes, 13 fewer than were originally ordered by NBC.
The third season will comprise 26 episodes that will air in two blocks without reruns.
The first half of the season made up the third volume, Villains, and the second half comprises the fourth volume, Fugitives.
The season premiered on September 22, 2008 in the United States on NBC and on Global in Canada, with a one-hour clip-show and two regular episodes.
Originally, the second season of Heroes was to be followed in April and May 2008 by six stand-alone episodes of a new series, Heroes: Origins.
The spin-off was intended as an alternative to a long mid-season hiatus, which led to a drop in ratings for Heroes in its first season.
The project, which was later planned to be 12 episodes, was indefinitely postponed due to a decline in viewership and the strike and eventually cancelled to keep "the Heroes mothership as strong as possible," according to NBC co-chairman Ben Silverman.
A series of three webisodes collectively titled Going Postal became available exclusively online in July 2008.
Following the release of Going Postal, three more sets of webisodes were produced, entitled Heroes: Destiny, The Recruit, and Hard Knox.
