The 2009 Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to U.S. President Barack Obama "for his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples".
The award was announced on October 9, 2009.
As specific examples of the work that led to the award, the Committee highlighted efforts to promote nuclear nonproliferation, and a "new climate" in international relations fostered by Obama, especially in reaching out to the Muslim world.
The White House announced Obama would travel to Oslo in December to accept the prize.
Obama plans to donate the full 10 million Swedish kronor (US$1.4 million) monetary award to charity.
Obama is the third African American to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize and third sitting U.S. President—eight and a half months after being sworn in as president.
Initial reaction to the award is mixed.
Among Nobel laureates, former U.S. Vice President Al Gore called the award "extremely well deserved", but former President of Poland Lech Wałęsa, who received the prize in 1983, said, "So soon?
This is too soon.
He has not yet made a real input".
The recipient in 1984, Desmond Tutu concluded, "It is a very imaginative and somewhat surprising choice.
It is wonderful".
Nomination and announcement
The five-member committee, chosen by the Norwegian Parliament to roughly reflect the party makeup of that body, included two members of the Labor Party, one from the Socialist Left Party, one from the Conservatives and one from the far-right Progress Party.
All five members backed the 2009 choice, said Thorbjørn Jagland (of the Labor Party), chairman of the Nobel Committee.
Jagland is a former Norwegian prime minister who was elected on September 29, 2009, as secretary general of the Council of Europe.
The panel met six or seven times in 2009, beginning several weeks after the February 1 nomination deadline.
The winner was picked on October 5.
There were a total of 205 nominations for the award.
Other nominees, including civil rights activists in China and Afghanistan, as well as African politicians, Colombian Senator Piedad Córdoba, Afghanistan's Sima Samar, Chinese dissident Hu Jia, and Prime Minister of Zimbabwe Morgan Tsvangirai, had been regarded as pre-announcement favorites for the award.
Jagland said he hoped the award would assist Obama's foreign policy efforts.
He added: "We have not given the prize for what may happen in the future.
We are awarding Obama for what he has done in the past year.
And we are hoping this may contribute a little bit for what he is trying to do".
Jagland said the committee was influenced by a speech Obama gave about Islam in Cairo in June 2009, as well as the president's efforts to prevent nuclear proliferation and climate change, as well as Obama's support for using established international bodies such as the United Nations to pursue foreign policy goals.
According to The New York Times, when Jagland was "asked if the committee feared being labeled naïve for accepting a young politician’s promises at face value", he shrugged and answered, "Well, so?
"
Obama is the third sitting U.S. President to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize: Theodore Roosevelt won the award in 1906 and Woodrow Wilson won in 1919.
In addition, former President Jimmy Carter won the award in 2002, in 1925, then-current  Vice President Charles Dawes won the prize with Austen Chamberlain, and former Vice President Al Gore shared the 2007 prize with the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
Obama is also the third African American to win this honor — Ralph J. Bunche was the Nobel laureate for 1950 and Martin Luther King, Jr., received the prize in 1964.
Reactions
Obama's winning of the peace prize was largely unanticipated and called a "stunning surprise" by The New York Times, though major oddsmaker Centrebet had in fact put him at 7-1 odds of winning, with Piedad Cordoba and Sima Samar at 6-1 and Morgan Tsvangirai at 7-1.
In a press conference following the award announcement, reporters noted that Obama had been the president for around nine months, and had made only some progress in achieving his ambitious international agenda.
Jagland expressed the hope that the prize would add momentum to Obama's efforts, while saying that it had not been awarded for "what may happen in the future.
We are awarding Obama for what he has done in the past year.
And we are hoping this may contribute a little bit for what he is trying to do".
The award drew initial criticism that it was undeserved or premature due to a perceived lack of significant accomplishments on Obama's part so far and his role in conflicts abroad.
However, opinions were divided.
Several other recipients were elected to national office the previous year, including Oscar Arias and Aung San Suu Kyi, a situation that also would have applied to nominee Tsvangirai.
The committee claimed the choice could be seen as an early vote of confidence in Obama intended to build global support for his policies.
The response from U.S. allies was overwhelmingly positive.
Barack Obama
Obama said he was "surprised" and "deeply humbled" by the award.
He stated that he does not feel he deserved the award, saying that he did not feel worthy of the company the award would place him in.
In remarks given at the White House Rose Garden on the day of the announcement, Obama stated, "I do not view it as a recognition of my own accomplishments but rather an affirmation of American leadership on behalf of aspirations held by people in all nations".
"Throughout history, the Nobel Peace Prize has not just been used to honor specific achievement; it's also been used as a means to give momentum to a set of causes," Obama said.
"And that is why I will accept this award as a call to action — a call for all nations to confront the common challenges of the 21st century".
He said those common challenges included the goal of eliminating nuclear weapons (which he said might not occur in his lifetime), nuclear proliferation, climate change, tolerance "among people of different faiths and races and religions", peace between and security for Israelis and Palestinians, better social conditions for the world's poor, including "the ability to get an education and make a decent living; the security that you won't have to live in fear of disease or violence without hope for the future".
The United States, he said, is "a country that's responsible for ending a war and working in another theater to confront a ruthless adversary that directly threatens the American people and our allies".
The award, he said, "must be shared with everyone who strives for justice and dignity — for the young woman who marches silently in the streets on behalf of her right to be heard even in the face of beatings and bullets; for the leader imprisoned in her own home because she refuses to abandon her commitment to democracy; for the soldier who sacrificed through tour after tour of duty on behalf of someone half a world away; and for all those men and women across the world who sacrifice their safety and their freedom and sometime their lives for the cause of peace".
He did not take questions from reporters after giving his statement.
International community
Government officials around the world congratulated Obama.
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon commended the Nobel Committee's choice.
"We are entering an era of renewed multilateralism [...] President Obama embodies the new spirit of dialogue and engagement on the world's biggest problems: climate change, nuclear disarmament and a wide range of peace and security challenges".
Several previous winners congratulated Obama and supported the choice, including former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, the 1990 Nobel peace prize winner.
Bangaladeshi Economist Muhammad Yunus, a co-winner of the 2006 prize, said the committee's award to Obama was "an endorsement of him and the direction he is taking".
South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the winner in 1984, said the award to Obama "anticipates an even greater contribution towards making our world a safer place for all".
But Mairead Corrigan, co-winner of the 1976 Nobel Peace Prize, expressed her disappointment with the choice, stating, "[g]iving this award to the leader of the most militarized country in the world, which has taken the human family against its will to war, will be rightly seen by many people around the world as a reward for his country's aggression and domination".
Lech Wałęsa, who won the 1983 prize for his work as the co-founder of the Solidarity trade union, said the award was premature.
"He has not yet made a real input".
In Europe, French President Nicolas Sarkozy said the award would reinforce Obama's determination to work for justice and peace.
He added that the award "finally confirms the return of America in the hearts of all the peoples of the world".
Russian president Dmitry Medvedev said the award will encourage warmer U.S.–Russian relations, and he hoped it would "serve as an additional incentive" for both governments to foster a better "climate in world politics".
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown,Indian President Pratibha Patil, Israeli President and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Shimon Peres and other heads of state sent congratulatory messages to Obama In Indonesia, Masdar Mas'udi, deputy head of the Islamic organisation Nahdatul Ulama, praised Obama’s policy towards his country as confirmation of his worthiness as a Nobel laureate.
"I think it's appropriate because he is the only American president who has reached out to us in peace," he said.
"On the issues of race, religion, skin colour, he has an open attitude".
Stuart Rees, director of the Sydney Peace Foundation in Australia, questioned the award" "Perhaps the Nobel organisation wants to give him a magic wand.
I think the guy is full of promise, but I don't think the promise has been realised yet particularly in regards the Middle East".
In Japan, books about Obama started selling so quickly that publishers scrambled to print up more copies, and various government officials said they hoped his nuclear disarmament efforts would be supported by the prize.
Hope that Obama's efforts toward nuclear disarmament was also a part of congratulatory statements from Ireland's Taoiseach Brian Cowen, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Vatican spokesman Fr. Federico Lombardi, and the Dalai Lama, a 1989 peace prize laureate and head of the Tibetan government-in-exile.
Cuban president Fidel Castro called the award "positive" and said the prize should be seen as a criticism to the "genocidal policy" carried out by past U.S. presidents.
Venezualan Foreign Minister Nicolás Maduro said the award was a surprise and perhaps premature.
"As President Hugo Chávez said at the United Nations, (the Obama administration) is a government that has raised expectations and hopes in many people in the world, amid great contradictions".
In the United States
Reaction in the United States was not unanimous, but there was widespread surprise at the Nobel Committee's decision from commentators and editorial writers, with sharp criticism from the conservative end of the political spectrum.
According to The Washington Post news analyst Dan Balz, "[E]ven among his supporters there was a sense of surprise and even shock on Friday [the day of the announcement], a belief that the award was premature, a disservice and a potential liability".
Senator John McCain said the Nobel Committee's decision was likely based on expectations, not accomplishments, but " [...] I think Americans are always pleased when their president is recognized by something on this order".
Both criticism and support of Obama's reception of the award was widespread and numerous.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) stated, "President Obama is working to restore American leadership worldwide and build bonds of friendship across the globe.
The Nobel Peace Prize is a testament to his leadership and vision and a tribute to American values.
I offer my congratulations to President Obama on this outstanding achievement".
Rachel Maddow, a political commentator on MSNBC, suggested that Obama received the award for, amongst other things, his efforts to improve cooperation between nations.
Criticism of the award came mainly on grounds that it be undeserved or premature due to Obama's perceived lack of significant accomplishments so far, and due to American escalation of military conflict in Afghanistan and Pakistan.
A Los Angeles Times editorial said the committee "didn't just embarrass Obama, it diminished the credibility of the prize itself".
Both editorials agreed with the idea that the Nobel Committee was implicitly criticizing the policies of the Bush administration.
Matt Lauer, host of the NBC news program Today, stated on the air, “We’re less than a year into the first term of this president and there are no —  I'm not trying to be, you know, rude here — no major foreign policy achievements, to date.”
Commentators also criticized the Nobel Committee for awarding the prize for inappropriate reasons.
The Washington Post columnist Michael Gerson wrote that the committee members "have forfeited any claim to seriousness.
Peace — the kind of peace that keeps people from being killed and oppressed — is an achievement, not a sentiment.
The Nobel Peace Prize Committee can no longer distinguish between the two.
Intending to honor Obama, the committee has actually embarrassed him".
New Republic  editor Peter Beinart called it a "farce", saying Obama had "done nothing to deserve the prize".
Commentary's Peter Wehner wrote that the award was meant to be a "slap" at former President George W. Bush.
Wehner added that the Nobel Committee "long ago ceased to be a serious entity; this choice merely confirms that judgment".
Fred Greenstein, presidential historian and author and professor of politics emeritus at Princeton University, told FOXNews.com that giving President Obama the Nobel Peace Prize is a "premature canonization" and an "embarrassment to the Nobel process".
Slate magazine blogger Mickey Kaus, New York Times columnist David Brooks and George W. Bush's U.N. ambassador during the John Bolton amongst others, called for Obama to not accept the award, while Washington Post columnist Ruth Marcus pundit Michael Crowley speculated that it was a "mixed blessing" and would not help Obama.
In a mailing to party faithful, Republican Party chairman Michael Steele used the award to seek donations to help combat "the Democrats and their international leftist allies" who want a United States that is " subservient to the agenda of global redistribution and control".
He went on to criticize Obama, saying, "‘What has President Obama actually accomplished?’ It is unfortunate that the president’s star power has outshined tireless advocates who have made real achievements working towards peace and human rights".
Democratic Party National Committee communications director Brad Woodhouse mocked opposition criticism of the award by saying, "The Republican Party has thrown in its lot with the terrorists — the Taliban and Hamas this morning — in criticizing the President for receiving the Nobel Peace prize".
Allan Lichtman, professor of history at American University, pointed out that Obama's award was different from the previous sitting U.S. presidents who won the award.
Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson "were six or seven years into two-term presidencies, and Obama has not completed a single year of his presidency, so it makes very little sense".
Former Vice President Al Gore, himself a past recipient, said the award is "extremely well deserved [...] Much of what he has accomplished already is going to be far more appreciated in the eyes of history as it has been by the Nobel Committee".
In Norway
A poll conducted by Synovate for the newspaper Dagbladet showed that 43% of the Norwegian population believed giving Obama the prize was right, while 38% believed it was wrong.
19% had no opinion.
The poll showed a sharp divide between younger and older people; of those over 60 years of age 58% were for and only 31% against it.
Of those between 18 and 29 years of age, only 25% approved of the decision, while 42% disapproved.
The award divided opinion among politicians.
Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg congratulated Obama for a "well-deserved prize".
Siv Jensen, leader of the opposition Progress Party, said that while Obama had taken several good initiatives the committee should have waited to see their results.
Erna Solberg, leader of the Conservative Party, also said that the prize came early and increased pressure on Obama to live up to the expectation.
Torstein Dahle, the leader of the leftist party Red, called the award a scandal, citing the fact that Obama was the commander-in-chief of a country at war in Iraq and Afghanistan.
In Afghanistan
President Hamid Karzai said that Obama was the "appropriate" person to win the Nobel Peace Prize.
"His hard work and his new vision on global relations, his will and efforts for creating friendly and good relations at global level and global peace make him the appropriate recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize," said Siamak Hirai, a spokesman for Karzai.
Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said the decision was ridiculous, saying, "The Nobel prize for peace?
Obama should have won the 'Nobel Prize for escalating violence and killing civilians.
