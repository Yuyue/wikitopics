Kim Petras (born Tim Petras), a German teenager who is an aspiring pop singer, was born in 1992.
Petras is well-known for having undergone a male to female gender transition at an early age.
In 2008 she was signed to Joyce Records and released online her first single "Last Forever", which became popular on YouTube and Myspace (listened to 60,000 and 46,000 times respectively).
In September 2008 she released her first commercially available single "Fade Away" into the German market.
In 2006, Petras, then aged 13, appeared in a story on  Stern TV, a German television current affairs show..
In it she describes her "gender transition" and the medical treatment she receives at the Endokrinologikum (Hormone Center) in Hamburg by Dr. Achim WÃ¼sthof.
Petras received worldwide publicity the following year, aged 14, after she appeared in a German television documentary and a talk show in a push to get permission for early Gender Reassignment Surgery at age 16.
According to German law, a person must normally be at least 18 to be allowed to undergo this kind of surgery.
The publicity generated from the 2007 TV appearances resulted in many news articles describing her gender transition at age 12 and describing her as the "world's youngest transsexual".
However, this claim is erroneous as children as young as six have been diagnosed with Gender Identity Disorder and have begun the transition (though Petras may have been one of the youngest people to receive female hormone treatments.
).
However, Kim turned 16 in 2008, and announced in a November 2008 post on her blog that she had recently completed her Gender Reassignment Surgery.
This made Kim the youngest person known to have had sex reassignment surgery worldwide and when it finally hit the news on February 04 2009 there was massive worldwide intrest and publicity about it, with Kim even appearing on the front page of some newspapers.
