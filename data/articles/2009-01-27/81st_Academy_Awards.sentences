Voting trends and summary
Continuing a trend in recent years, the field of major nominees did not include a bona fide blockbuster at the U.S. box office, with all but one of the nominees for Best Picture performing even more poorly than those of the previous year.
However, the top money earner in this year's field of Best Picture nominees performed slightly better in box office receipts compared to last year's highest grossing Best Film nominee, Juno.
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button was the highest earner among the Best Picture nominees with $104.4 million in domestic box office receipts (compared to Juno which grossed $87 million prior to its nomination).
The film was followed by Slumdog Millionaire which earned $44.7 million, Milk with $20.7 million, and Frost/Nixon with $8.8 million.
The Reader rounded out the Best Picture nominees with $8.3 million.
Among the rest of the top 50 releases of 2008 in U.S. box office before the nominations, 32 nominations went to 8 films on the list.
Only The Dark Knight (1st), WALL-E (5th), Kung Fu Panda (6th), Bolt (19th), Tropic Thunder (20th), and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (21st) received nominations for best picture, directing, acting, or screenwriting.
The other top-50 box office hits that earned nominations were Iron Man (2nd), and Wanted (16th).
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, The Dark Knight, Iron Man, WALL-E, and Wanted each received more than two nominations.
For the first time since 2004, two films received more than eight nominations.
Slumdog Millionaire received ten nominations and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button received 13.
For the fourth consecutive year, four of the Best Picture nominees were rated R (under 17 requires accompanying adult).
Of the 85 nominations awarded to non-documentary feature films (apart from the Foreign Film category), a majority of 46 went to R-rated films (down from 50 one year earlier), 35 to films rated PG-13 (up from 29 the previous year), two to PG-rated films (down from 4 the year before) and eight to a G-rated film (up from five from last year).
Controversy
Following the nominations announcement, the Academy was accused of snubbing WALL-E, The Dark Knight, Revolutionary Road, Doubt, and The Wrestler, five critically praised films that were considered contenders for nominations in the five major categories.
It was also accused of snubbing Sally Hawkins for Best Actress and completely ignoring Clint Eastwood's Gran Torino,  as well as the glaring omission of Bruce Springsteen from the Best Song category, for his song from The Wrestler which took the 2009 Golden Globe Award.
