The February 2009 Victorian bushfires involve hundreds of bushfires, including 31 major bushfires, ignited across the Australian state of Victoria, on 7 February 2009.
The fires have so far resulted in at least 173 deaths and are causing major property damage.
The fires have destroyed at least 922 homes , mostly in Kinglake and surrounding areas, with up to   of property being affected.
They occurred during the latter part of an exceptional heat wave, on a day when several localities across the state, including the state capital of Melbourne, recorded their highest temperatures since records began over 150 years previously.
The numerous fires are largely the result of recent lightning strikes, although some are suspected to have been deliberately lit by arsonists — whose action has been described as "mass murder" by the Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd.
Hundreds of buildings including schools, shops and offices and other places of work have been destroyed, particularly in the Kinglake fire complex, north-east of Melbourne and in west Gippsland.
78 people have been admitted to hospitals across Victoria with burns, at least 20 in a critical condition, and 9 on life support or in intensive care.
Many towns northeast of Melbourne have been almost completely destroyed, particularly; Kinglake, Marysville and Narbethong, with more than 80 percent of Marysville destroyed.
Small spot and grass fires were burning across the greater Melbourne area, with many outlying suburbs and towns affected.
Several train lines were closed including the Belgrave, Gippsland, Seymour and Warrnambool lines, and the main line between Melbourne and Sydney.
The Hume and Princes Freeways and numerous other major roads and highways were closed for various periods of time.
Smoke from the fires spread extensively, crossing the Tasman Sea and reaching as far as New Zealand.
Major fires
The major fires include:
North and central
Kinglake fire complex
The Kinglake fire complex, centred on Kinglake, was created by the merger of two earlier fires, the Kilmore fire and the Murrindindi Mill fire.
The complex had burned out over   as of 8 February.
A fire starting at Kilmore East, on the afternoon of 7 February, pushed   south-east towards Kinglake through Wandong and Clonbinane.
As many as 30 houses were feared destroyed at Wandong and Heathcote Junction on 7 February.
By 8 February it was estimated that 150 houses had been destroyed at Wandong, and four people killed.
The fire led to the closure of the Seymour railway line and parts of the Hume Highway.
The cool change passed through the area around 7:30pm, bringing south-westerly winds, which switched the fire's movement north-east towards Kinglake.
By the evening of 8 February, as many as 100 people displaced by the Kilmore fire were sheltering at an emergency relief centre established in a basketball stadium at Wallan, many of them unable to return to their homes because of safety roadblocks.
The fire front pushed through the Kinglake area late on 7 February, and it was to be the worst impacted area in the state, with more than 550 houses destroyed.
In Kinglake at least 33 people were confirmed dead, with another 12 deceased in Kinglake West.
The town of Marysville (at the eastern end of the complex) was almost entirely destroyed by the fire.
Late in the afternoon of 7 February, residents had anticipated that the fire front would bypass Marysville, but within minutes the town was enveloped in fire.
At about 5pm, power was lost to the town and the wind dropped away; minutes later the wind returned from a different direction, bringing the fire up the valley with it.
About 30 residents waited out the night at Gallipoli Park, and were evacuated to Alexandra on the afternoon of 8 February.
A police sergeant said that the main street in Marysville had been destroyed: "The motel at one end of it partially exists.
The bakery has survived.
Don't ask me how.
Everything else is just nuked".
Unknown damage to the water treatment plant at Marysville probably rendered local water supplies unsafe to drink.
An eyewitness reported that 95 percent of the houses in nearby Narbethong were also destroyed.
Other localities affected by the same fire included Taggerty and Buxton.
To the south, visitors and residents were stranded at Yarra Glen when fire surrounded the town on three sides.
Beechworth fire
In Beechworth, a fire has burnt over   and threatens the towns of Yackadandah, Stanley, Bruarong, Dederang, Kancoona, Kancoona South, Coralbank, Glen Creek and Running Creek.
The fire started at 7 p.m. on 7 February,   south of Beechworth, before being driven south through pine plantations by hot northerly winds.
The fire destroyed an unknown number of buildings at Mudgegonga, south-east of Beechworth, 2 have been confirmed dead.
Dense smoke and cloud cover had hindered assessment of the Beechworth fire, but as conditions cleared late on 8 February, aerial crews were anticipating being able to commence surveys of the situation.
Bendigo fire
A fire to the west of the city of Bendigo burned out  .
The fire broke out at about 4:30 p.m. on the afternoon of 7 February, and burned through Long Gully and Eaglehawk, coming within   of central Bendigo, before it was brought under control late on 8 February.
It destroyed approximately 45 houses in Bendigo's western suburbs, and damaged an electricity transmission line, resulting in blackouts to substantial parts of the city.
One Long Gully resident, ill and confined to his house, was killed in the fire despite the efforts of his neighbours to rescue him.
A second person was later confirmed dead.
The fire changed direction late on 7 February with the cool change, and headed back towards Eaglehawk; it was contained around lunchtime on 8 February, though it was still burning within containment lines later that day.
A relief centre was set up at Kangaroo Flat Senior Citizens Centre.
During the fire, residents from Long Gully, Eaglehawk, Maiden Gully, California Gully and West Bendigo were evacuated and advised to assemble at the centre.
A town meeting was held for the affected residents on 8 February.
On the same day, the Victoria Police indicated that they were investigating whether arson was the cause of the fire.
The CFA concluded that the most likely cause was a cigarette butt discarded from a car or truck on the highway.
Redesdale fire
In Redesdale, there has been   burnt, with the fire starting   west of the town.
The fire is reported as threatening the towns of Baynton and Glenhope.
East
Bunyip fire
A fire at Bunyip Ridge led to the destruction of houses at Longwarry and Drouin West, along with farms and businesses including the Jindi Cheese factory, after the fire jumped the Princes Highway.
The progress of the fire had been stopped by the afternoon of 9 February, though it had burned through  .
The fire destroyed at least 8 houses, in addition to various outbuildings and a factory.
DSE crews conducted backburning operations to ensure containment of the fire on 9 February, warning residents of areas between Pakenham and Warragul about smoke from those fires.
Farmers, unable to keep stock on their farms because of fire damage, were storing stock at nearby saleyards; by 9 February, hundreds of head of cattle affected by the Bunyip fire were en route to saleyards at Pakenham.
Churchill fire
The Churchill fire complex began in a pine plantation   south-east of Churchill on the afternoon of 7 February.
Within 30 minutes it had spread to the south-east, threatening Hazelwood South, Traralgon South, Jeeralang, and Budgeree East; by late afternoon the fire was approaching Yarram and Woodside on the south Gippsland coast.
The cool change came through the area about 6pm, but the south-westerly winds it brought pushed the fire north-east towards Gormandale and Willung South on the Hyland Highway.
About 500 evacuees from the area sheltered at an emergency centre established in a theatre in Traralgon.
The fire threatened the Loy Yang Power Station, particularly the station's open-cut coal mine.
On the night of 7 February, the fire approached the mine's overburden dump, but did not damage any infrastructure, nor did it affect the station's operations.
Several small fires broke out in the bunker storing raw coal from the mine, but were contained with no damage.
The threat eased by the evening of 8 February as temperatures cooled and some light rain fell; one small spot fire broke out to the south of the power station, but it was contained by water bombing aircraft.
By 9 February, the Churchill fire complex was still burning out of control, with fronts through the Latrobe Valley and the Strzelecki Ranges.
By late that afternoon, the complex had burnt out   and had killed nineteen people.
Wind changes that evening exacerbated parts of the Churchill complex, causing the CFA to issue further warnings to residents at Won Wron and surrounding areas.
On 9 February, police were investigating the theft of a CFA volunteer's uniform from his car in Churchill that morning.
Dandenong Ranges fire
In Ferntree Gully and Upper Ferntree Gully all major roads were closed.
Located within the Dandenong Ranges, fire damaged the rail track around Upper Ferntree Gully, causing the closure of the Belgrave railway line.
The fire, which was contained by CFA crews within three hours, burned at least   along the railway.
Narre Warren
In Narre Warren there have been several fires.
Six homes were destroyed in Narre Warren South and three in Narre Warren North.
West
Horsham fire
The Horsham fire burnt  , including the golf club and eight homes.
The Dimboola fire ute was also destroyed.
The fire was started at 12:30 p.m. on 7 February when strong winds felled a power pole at Remlaw, west of the city, before heading south-west and then south-east, across the Wimmera Highway and Wimmera River to the Horsham Golf Course and then to Haven, south of the city.
Firefighters managed to save the general store, town hall and school at Haven, though flames came within metres of those buildings.
Winds of up to  , that changed direction three times throughout the day, produced conditions described by the local CFA incident controller as the worst he had ever seen.
To the south-west of Horsham, a taxi driver collected his fare, an 82-year-old wheelchair-bound woman and her daughter, from her house as the fire was no more than   away; the house was alight as the taxi drove off, and burned down within minutes.
At 3 p.m. more than 400 personnel were engaged in fighting the fire, as well as two water-bombing aircraft, 54 Country Fire Authority (CFA) tankers and 35 Department of Sustainability and the Environment (DSE) units.
By 6 p.m. the front had moved east, and as the wind changed, was then pushed north-east across the Western Highway to Drung, east of Horsham.
Coleraine fire
Coleraine had   burnt, with one man left nursing severe burns.
The fire is reported to be under control.
Weerite fire
At Weerite, east of Camperdown, a fire burnt  , and damaged the rail line between Geelong and Warrnambool.
The fire caused unquantified losses of stock, and destroyed several outbuildings, but all houses under threat were saved by CFA firefighters.
The fire was thought to have been started by sparking power lines along the Princes Highway, which is now open to traffic at restricted speeds.
It is expected that the rail line will not re-open until at least Friday 13 February, 2009 at the earliest.
Responses
Aid efforts
Humanitarian  responses to the fires came quickly, from government, businesses and aid agencies, including direct relief efforts as well as fundraising.
The Victorian Government's Department of Human Services offered immediate assistance of up to $1067 for affected people.
The federal government announced a $10 million package of emergency assistance, available from 9 February, providing $1,000 per adult and $400 per child for those who had been hospitalised with injuries or who had lost their homes.
The appeal started by the Australian Red Cross had, by 10 am on 10 February, raised some $15.1 million from over 88,000 donors.
3,733 people have registered with the Red Cross after evacuating their properties.
The Red Cross' Blood Service received 6,000 offers of blood donations on the morning of 9 February alone.
Major banks NAB, ANZ, the Commonwealth Bank and Westpac each announced $1 million in donations for fire victims.
The Bendigo Bank donated $100,000 to seed a public donations appeal.
The ANZ announced further relief for its farm customers, with cash grants available to those whose infrastructure or livestock have been partially ($5,000) or wholly ($10,000) destroyed.
The chief executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry encouraged workplaces to take up collections to benefit victims.
Cricket Australia announced that the 10 February match between Australia and New Zealand would be used to raise money for fire victims, with itself, sponsor the Commonwealth Bank and cricket broadcaster Nine Network to appeal for donations during the match.
Football Federation Australia has also donated $100,000 to the Red Cross Bushfire Appeal and will provide replacement football equipment to Victorian schools and junior clubs affected by the disaster.
The AFL has announced that the NAB Cup match between Essendon Bombers and Western Bulldogs, scheduled to be played in Darwin on 13 February, would instead be played at the Telstra Dome in Melbourne, and would be called the NAB Cup Bushfire Appeal match; all proceeds from the match are to be donated towards relief efforts.
Government
While the federal parliament was suspended due to the emergency, the Crown-in-Council continued to address the disaster.
The Premier of Victoria, John Brumby, accepted from Prime Minister Kevin Rudd an offer to advise the Governor-General to dispatch members of the Australian Defence Force to provide assistance in that state.
Rudd described the bushfires as an "appalling tragedy for Victoria," saying "Hell and all its fury has visited the good people of Victoria in the last 24 hours".
The Queen of Australia stated that she "was shocked and saddened to learn of the terrible toll being exacted by the fires this weekend," and sent "heartfelt condolences to the families of all those who have died and... deep sympathy to the many that have lost their homes in this disaster," as well as expressing admiration for the firefighters and other emergency personnel.
The prime ministers of the United Kingdom and New Zealand offered support to the Australian government, which accepted the offer of 100 fire fighting personnel from New Zealand.
Investigations
Investigations began almost immediately following the fires to identify victims, and by 10 February the Victoria Police were engaged in investigating the origin of the fires and people who might have started them.
Chief Commissioner of the Victoria Police, Christine Nixon, formed a taskforce to assist in identifying victims, coordinated by Inspector Greg Hough.
The New South Wales Police Force, Western Australia Police and Tasmania Police   have sent officers trained in disaster victim identification to assist in this task.
Nixon stated on 9 February that all fire sites would be treated as crime scenes.
On that day a man was arrested in connection with the fires at Narre Warren; it was alleged by police that he had been operating a power tool, sparks from which ignited a grass fire, destroying two houses.
Premier John Brumby announced that there will be a Royal Commission into the fires, which will examine "all aspects of the government's bushfire strategy".
Brumby suggested that the long-standing 'stay-and-defend-or-leave-early' policy would be reviewed, saying that while it had proven reliable during normal conditions, the conditions on 7 February had been exceptional.
Brumby said that "There were many people who had done all of the preparations, had the best fire plans in the world and tragically it didn't save them".
However, Commissioner Nixon defended the policy, saying that it was "well thought of and well based and has stood the test of time and we support it".
Similarly, Commissioner of the New South Wales Rural Fire Service Shane Fitzsimmons said that "Decades of science, practice and history show that a well-prepared home provides the best refuge in the event of fire".
Nixon also dismissed potential policies involving forced evacuations, saying "There used to be policies where you could make people leave but we're talking about adults".
Former Victorian police minister Pat McNamara argued that forced evacuations could have worsened the death toll, as many of the dead appeared to have been killed while attempting to evacuate the fire areas by car.
Naomi Brown, chief executive of the Australasian Fire and Emergency Services Authorities Council, argued that the high number of fatalities in these fires, as opposed to earlier fires such as the Ash Wednesday fires, was partly attributable to increased population densities at Melbourne's fringes.
David Packham, research fellow at Monash University, argued that high fuel loads in bushland led to the destructive intensity of the fires, saying that "There has been total mismanagement of the Australian forest environment".
Federal member of parliament and former forestry minister Wilson Tuckey also identified high fuel loads as a key contributor to the destruction, saying "Governments who choose to lock up these forests and... treat them with benign contempt, well, others pay the penalty".
Tuckey put the blame for fuel loads on the two major parties – Labor and the Coalition – asserting that they "go running around putting in more reserves to get Green preferences".
Media and community
All major Australian television channels increased their nightly bulletin times to cover the fires in more detail.
ABC Local Radio in Victoria postponed programs to relay up to the minute news of the fires, from 7 February onwards.
On 7 February the Australian Broadcasting Corporation established a message board where people could offer or request help, and was inundated with replies.
From the start of the bushfires on 7 February, several organisations and individuals used the microblogging service Twitter to post updates on the developing situation.
Most notably these were a conversion of the Country Fire Authority's RSS stream,  @cfa_updates, and the ABC's  @774melbourne, the local emergency radio station.
Users also established  and  channels.
Casualties
173 people have been confirmed to have been killed by the fires including  Brian Naylor, former Seven Network and Nine Network television personality and his wife Moiree, who have been confirmed amongst the dead in the Kinglake West area.
