Farrah Fawcett (born February 2, 1947) is an American actress.
She is a noted pop culture figure whose hairstyle was emulated by millions of young women, and a sex symbol for millions of young men in the 1970s and 1980s.
She went on to become a critically accepted actress, appearing off-Broadway and in acclaimed television movies in challenging (The Burning Bed, Nazi Hunter: The Beate Klarsfeld Story, Poor Little Rich Girl: The Barbara Hutton Story, Margaret Bourke-White), and sometimes unsympathetic (Small Sacrifices) roles.
Early life
Farrah Fawcett was born as Ferrah Leni Fawcett in Corpus Christi, Texas, to Pauline Alice (née Evans), a homemaker, and James Fawcett, an oil field contractor.
Farah (فرح) is an Arabic word for "joy".
Ferrah (later changed to "Farrah") attended Spring Branch Junior High School near Houston for one year.
She graduated from W. B. Ray High School in Corpus Christi 1965.
She was given the title "Most Beautiful" with Gray Evans being runner up.
She attended the University of Texas at Austin and is a sister of Delta Delta Delta Sorority.
Career
The late 1960s and early 1970s saw Fawcett doing guest spots and TV commercials for products such as Noxema shaving cream  (video clip).
She also appeared on TV's The Dating Game  (video clip).
In April 1976, a poster company Pro Arts Inc., that had started out making anti-war posters, started to hear about a young up-and-coming beauty named Farrah Fawcett doing Wella Balsam shampoo commercials.
They got in touch with her agent at the time, Rick Hersh, and arranged a photo shoot.
Fawcett arranged to have Bruce McBroom, a freelance photographer with whom she had worked before, do the shoot.
McBroom took the pictures by the pool  at Farrah's Bel Air, California home.
For the back drop, McBroom used the worn, old Indian blanket covering his 1937 Chevrolet car seat.
Charlie's Angels and the birth of the Farrah phenomenon
On September 22, 1976, the first episode of Fawcett playing the character Jill Munroe in the TV series Charlie's Angels was aired.
Around the same time, her swimsuit poster was released.
It went on to sell a still-unrivaled 12 million copies and she became known for her tousled hair and bright smile.
The hairstyle went on to become an international trend, with women sporting a "Farrah Do" or "Farrah Hair" and the hairstyle was even spoofed in various media, including Redd Foxx's variety show on ABC and Dynamite magazine.
Charlie's Angels went on to become a huge hit, winning Fawcett a People's Choice Award, but after just one year Fawcett left the show.
As settlement to a lawsuit stemming from her early departure, Fawcett appeared three more times as a guest star in each of seasons three and four.
Cheryl Ladd (who portrayed Jill's younger sister Kris Munroe) joined the show during the interim.
In 2004, the TV movie Behind the Camera: The Unauthorized Story of Charlie's Angels dramatized the events from the show with actress Tricia Helfer portraying Fawcett and Ben Browder portraying Lee Majors, Fawcett's then-husband.
Establishing herself as a "serious actress"
Fawcett achieved critical praise and the first of three Emmy Award nominations as a serious actress for her role as a battered wife in the fact-based 1984 TV movie The Burning Bed.
The project is noted as being the first TV movie to provide a nationwide 800 number that offered help for others in the situation, in this case victims of domestic abuse.
Extremities
Fawcett also won acclaim in the off-Broadway stage and movie version of Extremities, in which she played a rape victim who turns the tables on her attacker.
During the June 21, 1983, performance of Extremities, despite two bodyguards backstage, Fawcett was accosted onstage by a crazed fan.
When the lights came on at the start of a scene, Fawcett found herself less than twenty-four inches away from a panting man who clutched what appeared to be a lead pipe.
After staring at each other for a moment, the man snarled, “I love you, I love you.
I’ve been looking for you!” Fawcett's instinct was to press on with the scene, but the man continued to yell at her until Fawcett paused, visibly shaken.
Co-star Scot Land and the show’s producer jumped to the stage and wrestled the man away from Fawcett.
Working himself free from their grip, the man fled the theater.
Officers responding to the situation found the would-be attacker sitting on a stoop near the theater but were unable to prosecute him.
The “lead pipe” turned out to be a rolled-up poster painted silver, preventing a weapons charge.
The man had purchased a ticket, so they could not charge him with trespassing.
Even though the man was on parole for murder, his past had no bearing on this case.
All police could do under laws of the time was issue a summons for disorderly conduct.
In 1986 Fawcett appeared in the movie version, for which she received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Performance by an Actress in a Motion Picture — Drama.
Art meets life
After filming Jon Avnet's Between Two Women with Colleen Dewhurst (who won her first Emmy for her role, after 30 years in television and seven nominations), Fawcett embarked upon a series of high profile telefilms portraying real-life women, both famous and infamous.
She was nominated for Golden Globe awards for portraying Nazi-hunter Beate Klarsfeld and troubled Woolworth heiress Barbara Hutton, and won a Cable Ace Award for her portrayal of groundbreaking Life Magazine photojournalist Margaret Bourke-White.
Next she played an infamous killer in the 1989 miniseries Small Sacrifices, receiving a second Emmy nomination for the predatory role.
Fawcett, who steadfastly resisted appearing nude in films or magazines throughout the 1970s and 1980s, caused a major stir by posing nude in the December 1995 issue of Playboy, which became the best-selling issue of the 1990s, with over 4 million copies sold worldwide.
At the age of 50, she returned to the pages of Playboy with a pictorial for the July 1997 issue, which also became a top seller.
That same year, Fawcett was chosen by Robert Duvall to play his wife in an independent feature film he was producing, The Apostle.
Fawcett received an Independent Spirit Award nomination as Best Actress for the film.
In 2000, she worked with director Robert Altman and an all-star cast in the feature film Dr. T and the Women, playing the wife of Richard Gere.
That year, Fawcett's collaboration with sculptor Keith Edmier was exhibited at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, later traveling to the Andy Warhol Museum.
The sculpture was also presented in a series of photographs and a book by Rizzoli.
Fawcett continued to work in television during the period, with well-regarded appearances on popular television series including Ally McBeal and four episodes each of Spin City and The Guardian, her work on the latter show earning her a third Emmy nomination in 2004.
Personal life
Fawcett was married to Lee Majors, star of The Six Million Dollar Man, from 1973–1982, though the two separated in 1979.
During this time, she was known as Farrah Fawcett-Majors.
From 1982 to the present, Fawcett has been involved romantically with actor Ryan O'Neal.
The relationship produced a son, Redmond O'Neal, who was born in 1985.
Redmond has struggled with addiction.
Convicted of driving under the influence, he has been arrested for possession of narcotics, including on April 5, 2009, following a routine search at a jail security checkpoint while Fawcett was in the hospital.
On June 5, 1997, Fawcett received some negative commentary after giving a rambling and distracted interview on The Late Show with David Letterman.
Months later, she told the host of The Howard Stern Show that her behavior was in fact just her way of joking around with the television host, explaining that what appeared to be random looks across the theater was just her looking and reacting to fans in the audience.
Though the Letterman appearance spawned speculation and several jokes at her expense, after Joaquin Phoenix's mumbling act on a February 2009 appearance on The Late Show, Letterman wrapped up the interview by saying, "Joaquin, I’m sorry you couldn’t be here tonight", followed by, "We owe an apology to Farrah Fawcett".
Fawcett's elder sister, Diane Fawcett Walls, died from lung cancer just short of her 63rd birthday, on October 16, 2001.
The fifth episode of her 2005 Chasing Farrah series followed the actress home to Texas to visit with her father, James, and mother, Pauline.
Pauline died soon after, on March 4, 2005, at the age of 91.
The following year saw the deaths of her agent, Jay Bernstein, and one-time mentor Aaron Spelling, producer of Charlie's Angels.
On the 30th anniversary of the show's debut, Fawcett and original Angels Kate Jackson and Jaclyn Smith appeared on television together for the first time in nearly as many years to pay tribute to Spelling at the 58th Primetime Emmy Awards.
Cancer
On October 4, 2006, it was revealed that Fawcett was suffering from anal cancer, and was undergoing treatment, including chemotherapy and surgery.
The Associated Press wire service reported on her 60th birthday that Fawcett was, at that point, cancer free.
Fawcett said in a statement, "This is an extraordinarily happy day for me and my family.
I hope that my news might offer some level of inspiration to others who unfortunately must continue to fight the disease".
On Wednesday, May 16, 2007, it was reported that a malignant polyp was found in the area where Fawcett had been treated for the initial cancer.
Doctors contemplated whether to implant a radiation seeder (which differs from conventional radiation and is used to treat other types of cancer).
Fawcett, however,  chose to travel to Germany (with O'Neal) for holistic treatments.
This treatment in Germany has been recorded for a possible reality television show.
On Saturday, April 4, 2009, it was reported that Fawcett had been rushed to a hospital several days earlier, where she was unconscious and in critical condition.
Subsequent reports, however, indicated that the severity of her condition was not as dire as first reported.
An April 6, 2009, AP article reported that her cancer had metastasized to her liver.
Fawcett had learned of this development in May 2007 and the treatment she has received since then has targeted this as well.
The report denied that she was unconscious, and illuminated that the reason for Fawcett's hospitalization was not her cancer but a painful abdominal hematoma that had been the result of a minor procedure, according to the Los Angeles cancer specialist treating Fawcett, Dr. Lawrence Piro.
Her spokesperson emphasized she is not "at death's door", adding "She remains in good spirits with her usual sense of humor ... She's been in great shape her whole life and has an incredible resolve and an incredible resilience".
On April 9, the AP reported that Fawcett had been released from the hospital, that longtime companion O'Neal had picked her up, and that according to her doctor, she was "walking and in great spirits and looking forward to celebrating Easter at home".
On May 7, People Magazine reported that Ms. Fawcett is critically ill and quoted O'Neal as saying her treatment had pretty much ended and that she now spends her days at home, often asleep.
After this announcement, the Los Angeles Times reported that Fawcett is in the last stages of her cancer and had the chance to see her son in April 2009 under supervision, as he was currently incarcerated.
Her son reported that her weight was down to 86 pounds.
In addition to her son, her 91-year-old father was being flown out to visit with his ailing daughter.
O'Neal said she wrote him a note which read "I've lived a full and wonderful life.
I've loved and been loved.
I'm happy.
I'm ready".
A two-hour documentary, Farrah's Story, shot by Fawcett and her friend Alana Stewart about her battle with the disease, will air on NBC on May 15, 2009.
