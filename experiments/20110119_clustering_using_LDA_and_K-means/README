This experiment is meant to 
	i) explore the value of LDA in clustering Wikipedia pages
	into groups of related pages about events in real life and
	ii) explore the value of using different term weights
	such as tf and tf-idf and different metrics as a similarity
	measure such as cosine distance, KL divergence, weighted sum,
	and language models.

I. LDA.
