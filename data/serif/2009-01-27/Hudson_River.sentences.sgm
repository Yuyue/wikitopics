This picture shown on the side of the page is the Hudson River.
Now, we know that the founder of this river is Henry Hudson, which he became famous for.
We are looking for Colby Thomas Hudson who lives in Ravena , New york.
We are looking for Colby because he is the new owner of the Hudson River.
Congrats!
