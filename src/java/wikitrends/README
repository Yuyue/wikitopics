package wikitrends
==================

These are the Java files for processing the raw pagecounts data (wikistats data).

There are currently three Java classes for different purposes.
Convert: the script to collect page views for the list of Wikipedia events.
Redirect: the script to adjust page views using the redirect pages.
Trends: the script to run the Treding Topics algorithm and find the most viewed pages.


class Convert
=============

Reads in the events list and the directory in which the pagecounts data reside
and writes the pageview counts for the list of the events.

Usage
=====
java wikitrends.Convert events-link pagecounts-dir

events-link
	the file that has the list of the links, each of which is a Wikipedia article.
	One of the typical filename is events_links_2009.
	The format of the file is as follows:

20090101 0 BART_Police_shooting_of_Oscar_Grant
20090101 0 California
20090101 0 Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit
20090101 0 Fruitvale_%28BART_station%29
20090101 1 Israel
20090101 1 Jabalia
20090101 1 Gaza_Strip
20090101 1 Hamas
20090101 1 Nizar_Rayan
...

	The fields of each line are delimited by a space.
	The first field contains the date on which the event has occurred, the second field contains the number of the event, and the third field the link that the event contains, one link every line. One event may have multiple links in it.
	Only the third field matters for this script. The first and second field does not matter.

pagecounts-dir
	the directory in which the pagecounts data are located. e.g. data/wikistats/aggregate/en_daily/.
	The pagecounts files follow the following name convention: pagecounts-20090101.gz or pagecounts-20080131-180000.gz.


class Redirect
==============

reads in the redirect pages, non-redirect pages, and pagecounts data,
adjust counts so that the page views for the redirected pages into the pages to which that the redirects link,
and writes the counts in the pagecounts data format.

Note that this script currently process only English data.

Output is written into the standard output. Redirection may be used to make the output written in a plain text file.

Usage
