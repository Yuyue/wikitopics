Charles Hardin Holley, known professionally as Buddy Holly (September 7, 1936 – February 3, 1959) was an American singer-songwriter and a pioneer of rock and roll.
Although his success lasted only a year and a half before his death in an airplane crash, Holly is described by critic Bruce Eder as "the single most influential creative force in early rock and roll".
His works and innovations were copied by his contemporaries and later musicians, notably The Beatles, The Beach Boys and The Rolling Stones, and exerted a profound influence on popular music.
In 2004, Rolling Stone ranked Holly #13 on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.
Biography
Charles Hardin Holley was born in Lubbock, Texas to Lawrence Odell Holley and Ella Pauline Drake on Labor Day, in 1936.
The Holleys were a musical family and as a young boy Holley learned to play piano, guitar and violin (his brothers oiled the strings so much that no one could hear him play.
)  He was always known as Buddy to his family.
In 1949 Buddy made a recording of Hank Snow's 'My Two-Timin' Woman' on a wire recorder "borrowed" by a friend who worked in a music shop (not, as is often reported, a home tape recorder) , his first known recording.
During the fall of that year, he met Bob Montgomery at Hutchinson Junior High School.
They shared a common interest in music and soon teamed up as "Buddy and Bob".
Initially influenced by bluegrass music, they sang harmony duets at local clubs and high school talent shows.
In Lubbock, Holly attended Hutchinson Junior High School, which has a mural honoring him, and Lubbock High School, which has numerous features to honor the late musician.
His musical interests grew throughout high school while singing in the Lubbock High School Choir.
Holly turned to rock music after seeing Elvis Presley sing live in Lubbock in early 1955.
A few months later, on October 15, he opened on the same bill with Presley, also in Lubbock, catching the eye of a Nashville talent scout.
Holly's transition to rock continued when he opened for Bill Haley & His Comets at a local rock show organized by Eddie Crandall, who was also the manager for Marty Robbins.
As a result of this performance, Holly was offered a contract with Decca Records to work alone, which he accepted.
According to the Amburn book (p. 45), his public name changed from "Holley" to "Holly" on 8 February 1956, when the Decca contract he signed misspelled his last name.
That spelling was then adopted for his professional career.
Among the tracks recorded for Decca was an early version of "That'll Be The Day", which took its title from a phrase that John Wayne's character said repeatedly in the 1956 film, The Searchers.
Decca wouldn't publish his recordings and dropped his contract, but also insisted he could not record the same songs for anyone else for five years.
Back in Lubbock, Holly formed his own band, although at that time it had no name.
It would later be called The Crickets and began recording at Norman Petty's studios in Clovis, New Mexico.
Norman had music industry contacts and, believing that "That'll Be the Day" would be a hit single, he contacted publishers and labels.
Brunswick Records, a subsidiary of Decca, signed The Crickets.
Soon after, they signed Holly as a solo artist on another Decca subsidiary, Coral Records.
This put Holly in the unusual position of having two record contracts at the same time.
Before "That'll Be The Day" had its nationwide release, Holly played lead guitar on the single "Starlight", recorded in April 1957, featuring Jack Huddle.
The initial, unsuccessful version of "That'll Be The Day" played more slowly and about half an octave higher than the hit version.
Holly managed to bridge some of the racial divide that marked rock n' roll.
While Elvis made black music more acceptable to whites, Holly won over an all-black audience when the Crickets were booked at New York's Apollo Theater (though, unlike the immediate response depicted in the 1978 movie The Buddy Holly Story, it actually took several performances for his talents to be appreciated).
After the release of several highly successful songs in 1958, Holly and the Crickets toured Australia in January and later the United Kingdom.
That same year, he met Maria Elena Santiago (born 1935 in San Juan, Puerto Rico) while she was working as a receptionist for Peer-Southern Music, a New York music publisher.
According to a romanticised version encouraged by Maria Elena, he proposed to her on their very first date.
She initially thought he was kidding, but they were married in Lubbock on 15 August 1958, less than two months after they met.
"I'd never had a boyfriend in my life.
I'd never been on a date before.
But when I saw Buddy, it was like magic.
We had something special: love at first sight," Maria told the Lubbock Avalanche-Journal on what would have been their fiftieth wedding anniversary.
Maria traveled on some of the tours, doing everything from the laundry to equipment setup to ensuring the group got paid.
The ambitious Holly became increasingly interested in the New York music/recording/publishing scene, while his younger and more easygoing bandmates wanted to go back home to Lubbock.
As a result, the group split up in 1959.
Death
Holly began a solo tour with other notable performers, including Dion and the Belmonts, Ritchie Valens, and J. P. "The Big Bopper" Richardson.
After a performance in Green Bay, Wisconsin at the Riverside Ballroom, on 1 February, the tour moved on to the Surf Ballroom in Clear Lake, Iowa on 2 February 1959.
Afterwards, Buddy Holly chartered a Beechcraft Bonanza to take him and his new backup band (Tommy Allsup and Waylon Jennings) to Fargo, North Dakota, enroute to the next leg of the Winter Dance Party tour at the Armory in Moorhead, Minnesota.
Carl Bunch missed the flight as he had been hospitalized with frostbite three days earlier.
The Big Bopper asked Jennings for his spot on the four-seat plane, as he was recovering from the flu.
Ritchie Valens was still signing autographs at the concert site when Allsup walked in and told him it was time to go.
Valens begged for a seat on the plane.
Allsup pulled a 50 cent coin out of his pocket and the two men flipped for the seat.
Allsup lost.
The plane took off in light snow and gusty winds at around 12:55 A.M., but crashed a few minutes later.
The wreckage was discovered several hours later by the plane's owner, Jerry Dwyer, some   from the airport.
The crash killed Holly, Valens, Richardson, and the 21-year-old pilot, Roger Peterson.
Holly's body, along with those of Valens and Richardson, was thrown from the wreckage.
Without any doubt, all had died on impact.
While theories abound as to the exact cause of the crash, an official determination of pilot error was rendered by the Civil Aeronautics Board.
Don McLean referred to it as "The Day the Music Died".
Although the crash received a good deal of local coverage, it was displaced in the national news by an accident that occurred the same day in New York City.
American Airlines Flight 320 crashed during an instrument landing approach at LaGuardia Airport, killing 65.
Holly's pregnant wife became a widow after barely six months of marriage and miscarried soon after.
Holly's funeral was held on 7 February 1959 at the Tabernacle Baptist Church in Lubbock under the direction of Sanders Funeral Home.
His body was interred in the City of Lubbock Cemetery in the eastern part of the city.
Holly's headstone carries the correct spelling of his surname (Holley) and a carving of his Fender Stratocaster guitar.
Maria Holly did not attend the funeral and has never visited the grave site.
She told the Avalanche-Journal, "In a way, I blame myself.
I was not feeling well when he left.
I was two weeks pregnant, and I wanted Buddy to stay with me, but he had scheduled that tour.
It was the only time I wasn't with him.
And I blame myself because I know that, if only I had gone along, Buddy never would have gotten into that airplane".
Style
Holly's music was sophisticated for its day, including the use of instruments considered novel for rock and roll, such as the celesta (heard on "Everyday").
Holly was an influential lead and rhythm guitarist, notably on songs such as "Peggy Sue" and "Not Fade Away".
While Holly could pump out boy-loves-girl songs with the best of his contemporaries, other songs featured more sophisticated lyrics and more complex harmonies and melodies than had previously appeared in the genre.
Many of his songs feature a unique vocal "hiccup" technique, a glottal stop, to emphasize certain words in any given song, especially the rockers.
Other singers (such as Elvis) have used a similar technique, though less obviously and consistently.
Examples of this can be found at the start of the raucous "Rave On":  "Weh-eh-ell, the little things you say and do, make me want to be with you-ou..".
; in That'll Be the Day: "Well, you give me all your lovin' and your -turtle dovin'..".
; and in "Peggy Sue": "I love you Peggy Sue - with a love so rare and tr-ue .."..
Influence
Contrary to popular belief, teenagers John Lennon and Paul McCartney did not attend a Holly concert, although they watched his TV appearance on Sunday Night at the London Palladium; Tony Bramwell, a school friend of McCartney and George Harrison, did.
Keith Richards attended one of the gigs, where he heard "Not Fade Away" for the first time.
Bramwell met Holly, and freely shared his records with all three.
Lennon and McCartney later cited Holly as a primary influence.
(Their band's name, The Beatles, was chosen partly in homage to Holly's Crickets.
) The Beatles did a cover version of "Words of Love" that was a close reproduction of Holly's version.
Paul McCartney's band Wings recorded their version of Love is Strange on their first album Wild Life.
In addition, John Lennon recorded a cover version of the song Peggy Sue on his 1975 album Rock 'n' Roll.
McCartney owns the publishing rights to Holly's song catalogue.
A young Bob Dylan attended the 31 January 1959 show, two nights before Holly's death.
Dylan referred to this in his 1998 Grammy acceptance speech for his 1997 Time out of Mind winning Album of the Year:
Various rock and roll histories have asserted that the singing group The Hollies were named in homage to Buddy Holly.
According to the band's website, although the group admired Holly (and years later produced an album covering some of his songs), their name was inspired primarily by the sprigs of holly in evidence around Christmas of 1962.
The Rolling Stones had an early hit covering Holly's "Not Fade Away".
In an August 24, 1978 Rolling Stone interview, Bruce Springsteen told Dave Marsh, "I play Buddy Holly every night before I go on; that keeps me honest".
Discography
Buddy Holly had three albums released during his lifetime.
As Holly was signed to Decca both as a solo artist on Coral, and as part of The Crickets on Brunswick, two debut albums were released; The "Chirping" Crickets was released in November 1957, and Buddy Holly was released three months later in February 1958.
The third album, That'll Be the Day, was put together from early recordings when Holly was having some success, but had no recent material to release.
The album has a poor reputation among critics, containing only one notable song, the title track, "That'll Be The Day".
Posthumous record releases
Buddy Holly recorded so prolifically that Coral Records was able to release brand-new Buddy Holly albums and singles for 10 years after his death, although the technical quality of the recordings issued was very mixed, some being studio quality and others home recordings.
Holly's simple demonstration recordings were overdubbed by studio musicians, to bring them up to then-commercial standards.
The best of these overdubbed records is often considered to be the first posthumous single, the 1959 coupling of "Peggy Sue Got Married" and "Crying, Waiting, Hoping", produced by Jack Hansen, with added backing vocals by the Ray Charles Singers in simulation of an authentic Crickets record.
"Crying, Waiting, Hoping" was actually supposed to be the "A" side of the 45, with the backup group effectively echoing Buddy's call-and-response vocal.
The Hansen session, in which Holly's last six original compositions were overdubbed, was issued on the 1960 Coral LP  The Buddy Holly Story, Vol.
2.
But the best "posthumous" records were the studio recordings, which included "Wishing" and "Reminiscing".
Buddy Holly continued to be promoted and sold as an “active” artist, and his records had a loyal following, especially in Europe.
The demand for unissued Holly material was so great that Norman Petty resorted to overdubbing whatever he could find: alternate takes of studio recordings, originally rejected masters, “Crying, Waiting, Hoping” and the other five 1959 tracks (adding new surf-guitar arrangements), and even Holly's amateur demos from 1954 (where the low-fidelity vocals are often muffled behind the new orchestrations).
The last new Buddy Holly album was Giant (featuring the single, “Love Is Strange”), issued in 1969.
Between the 1959–60 Jack Hansen overdubs, the 1960s Norman Petty overdubs, various alternate takes, and Holly's undubbed originals, collectors can often choose from multiple versions of the same song.
Tributes
Songs
Don McLean's popular 1971 ballad "American Pie" is inspired by the day of the plane crash.
He has also covered "Everyday".
A disc jockey from San Bernardino, Tommy Donaldson penned a spoken tribute to the dead singers called "Three Stars" and recorded it under the name Tommy Dee, backed by a group called Carol Kay and the Teen-aires.
Eddie Cochran, Holly's good friend and fellow rock 'n' roll pioneer also recorded the song "Three Stars", but it was not released until after Cochran's own premature death, because he was too upset to allow it to be issued in his lifetime.
A 1980 Gyllene Tider song is called "Ska vi älska, så ska vi älska till Buddy Holly".
("If We Should Make Love, We Should Make Love (while listening) to Buddy Holly").
The Smithereens' song "Maria Elena" is a Buddy Holly tribute as sung to his widow.
Blink-182 has a song named "Peggy Sue" which is a tribute to Holly.
Phil Ochs famously sang a long tribute to Buddy Holly on the infamous Gunfight at Carnegie Hall album.
Mike Berry released a 1961 single called "Tribute to Buddy Holly".
It was written by Geoff Goddard and produced by Joe Meek, who was a great Buddy Holly fan.
In the USA, it was released on Coral, Buddy Holly's label.

In 1985, the German rock band Die Ärzte sang a song named "Buddy Hollys Brille" (Buddy Holly's glasses), in which they discussed in a humorous way the question of what happened to Buddy Holly's glasses after his death.
Mac Davis' "Happiness is Lubbock, Texas (In My Rearview Mirror)" also references Buddy Holly, with these lines:
I set out one night in June
Stoned by the glow of the Texas moon
Humming an old Buddy Holly tune called "Peggy Sue"
With my favorite jeans
And a cheap guitar
I ran off chasing a distant star
If Buddy Holly could make it that far
I figured I could too
Run-DMC's music video for the song "King of Rock" has an extended video on Buddy Holly performing on The Ed Sullivan Show.
Monuments
Downtown Lubbock has a "walk of fame" with plaques to various area artists such as Glenna Goodacre, Mac Davis, Maines Brothers Band, and Waylon Jennings, with a life-size statue of Buddy by sculptor Grant Speed (1980) playing his Fender guitar as its centerpiece.
Downtown Lubbock also features Buddy Holly Avenue and the Buddy Holly Center, which is a museum dedicated to Texas art and music.
In 1988, Ken Paquette, a Wisconsin fan of the 1950s, erected a stainless steel monument at the site of the airplane crash, depicting a steel guitar and a set of three records bearing the names of each of the three performers.
It is located on private farmland approximately five miles north of Clear Lake.
He also created a similar stainless steel monument to the three musicians at the Riverside Ballroom in Green Bay, Wisconsin.
That memorial was unveiled on July 17, 2003.
Other
The Surf Ballroom hosts an annual tribute on the anniversary of Holly's last performances.
The 'Winter Dance Party Tour' is a tribute tour to Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens, the Big Bopper and early rock and roll.
It gets its name from the tour that ended the lives of Holly, Valens and Richardson.
This reproduction of the tour ends every year at the Surf Ballroom in Clear Lake, Iowa.
Buddy Holly in popular culture
Film and musical depictions
The dramatic arc of Holly's life story inspired a Hollywood biographical film, The Buddy Holly Story.
Star Gary Busey received a nomination for Academy Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of Holly.
The movie was widely criticized by the rock community and Holly's friends and family for its inaccuracies.
This led Paul McCartney to produce and host his own tribute to Holly in 1985, titled The Real Buddy Holly Story.
This authoritative video includes interviews with Keith Richards, Phil and Don Everly, Sonny Curtis, Jerry Allison, Holly's family, and McCartney himself, among others.
In 1987, Marshall Crenshaw portrayed Buddy Holly in the movie La Bamba.
He is featured performing at the Surf Ballroom and boarding the doomed airplane with Ritchie Valens and The Big Bopper.
Crenshaw's version of Crying, Waiting, Hoping is featured on the La Bamba original motion picture soundtrack.
There were also successful Broadway and West End musicals documenting his career.
Buddy - The Buddy Holly Story ran in the West End for 13 years.
This was followed by a tour and return to the West End on 3 August 2007.
Holly, The Crickets and The Big Bopper are also depicted in a touring tribute act, Buddy Holly and The Cricketers.
They recently appeared on BBC1's The One and Only.
In the 1994 film Pulp Fiction, a scene depicts John Travolta and Uma Thurman's characters dining at a fictional 1950s themed restaurant named Jack Rabbit Slims.
The waiter, played by Steve Buscemi, is dressed as Buddy Holly.
The 1998 film Six-String Samurai, a surreal romp through an alternate-timeline post-apocalyptic America (Russia bombs and then invades the United States in 1957), features a rock-and-rolling martial arts hero named "Buddy" who sports familiar black horn-rimmed glasses and a tuxedo.
The film follows Buddy's journey to "Lost Vegas", the last outpost of freedom in the world, to claim the crown of the recently-deceased King Elvis.
The Ramones video for the song "Do You Remember Rock n' Roll Radio" features an extended clip of Buddy Holly performing on the Ed Sullivan Show.
The 1992 Nirvana video for the song "In Bloom" is filmed in Black and white using 1950s era television cameras and shows the band appearing in 1950s attire (Including Kurt Cobain wearing Buddy Holly style glasses) in an apparent tribute.
In 2007, Frankie Muniz portrayed Buddy Holly in Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story.
Books
The science fiction novel Buddy Holly Is Alive and Well on Ganymede, by Bradley Denton (ISBN 0-688-10822-9 and ISBN 0-380-71876-6), begins when television sets throughout the world suddenly begin broadcasting a concert by an apparently living Buddy Holly, who says he is on Ganymede.
In Soul Music, part of Terry Pratchett's Discworld, a character by the name of  Imp y Celyn appeared as a bard-cum-guitar-playing-rocker from the fictional Cymric country of Llamedos.
He became the Disc's greatest musician under the name Buddy in the Band with Rocks In, before dying in a cart crash (a reference to Buddy Holly as Imp's name translates as "bud of the holly").
In the alternate history series of novels Wild Cards, set in the 1980s, Buddy Holly is alive although he can't perform his classics any more because they were bought from him during difficult times.
After some time as a lounge act performing covers of other people's songs, he is brought back for a benefit concert where he performs new material, and also manifests a Wild Card ability.
Television
"Oil", an episode of The Young Ones features Mike (Christopher Ryan) discovering Buddy Holly, alive and well and tangled in parachutes, in the attic of a house in London.
A fictional version of a young pre-fame Buddy Holly is a secondary character in an episode of Quantum Leap, working as a veterinarian's assistant.
In the episode, Sam overhears Buddy strumming his guitar calling to a lost pig "Piggy, sooie" and realizes the identity of his heretofore anonymous assistant; Sam suggests Buddy change the words to "Peggy Sue".
The song "Everyday" is featured in the beginning of the LOST episode, "Cabin Fever", and in the Rob Reiner Film, Stand by Me.
In the X-Files episode "Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose" the character of Clyde Bruckman claims that his supernatural ability (to know precisely the circumstances under which everyone he touches will die) began when he became obsessed with the idea that The Big Bopper won his seat on the doomed flight with Holly as a result of a coin toss, that all the events in The Big Bopper's life lead him to a moment where his life and death depended on that toss.
It is unclear whether the Bruckman character's erroneous substitution of The Big Bopper for Ritchie Valens in his account was a goof by the writers of the episode, or an intentional error meant to reflect on the mental state of Bruckman.
In the Simpsons episode "Colonel Homer", the manager of the recording studio fondly recalled how "Buddy Holly stood on this spot in 1958 and said, 'There is no way in hell I am gonna record in this dump.
'" In a later episode, Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens and The Big Bopper appear on an Itchy and Scratchy cartoon.
Itchy sabotages the plane's engine, resulting in the crash that kills the musicians and pilot Scratchy.
In yet another episode, Lisa discovers Sideshow Bob had won election as mayor through votes by her two dead cats, Snowball I and Snowball II, as well as Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens and The Big Bopper (whose tombstone reads "good bye, baaaaby!!
").
In an episode of the MTV series Clone High, Holly "guest stars", along with Ritchie Valens, The Big Bopper, and several other musicians who died in plane crashes.
Holly legacy
Maria Holly told the Avalanche-Journal that some have called her "the Yoko Ono of Lubbock; they blame me for everything," a reference to controversies over using Holly's name to promote the City of Lubbock.
The city was forced to rename the Buddy Holly Walk of Fame to the West Texas Walk of Fame.
She recalled former Mayors Windy Sitton and David Langston as allies, but she said that she could not work well with former Mayor Marc McDougal.
"And I have not even received a phone call from the new Lubbock mayor or anyone in the City Council.
...
I've tried to help with an annual festival and symposium and concert.
Lubbock officials had gold in their hands, and they didn't know how to sift it," Maria told the newspaper.
Travis Holley, an older brother of Buddy, said, "I don't think Lubbock likes her.
She puts too many restrictions on using Buddy's name, whereas the family considers it an honor that the city wants to pay tribute to Buddy.
That is the reason I don't like Maria.
I don't like the way she's been so mercenary for so long about Buddy's name".
Maria Holly, however, has remained firm for a half century.
She contends that she is merely protecting her late husband's reputation.
On January 26, 2009, the city of Lubbock agreed to pay her $20,000 for the next 20 years to maintain the name of the Buddy Holly Center.
Additionally, land near the center will be named the Buddy and Maria Holly Plaza.
