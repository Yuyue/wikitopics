Overview
========

These are the scripts to evaluate various clusters against a different cluster.
You may evaluate one test set and gold standard pair at a time.

Input
=====
The cluster files are in the same format:
The title of an article is listed per line, and each cluster is divided by a blank line.
The first article of each cluster may be the centroid article of the cluster.
Comments followed by a hash (#) sign are allowed either at the beginning or end of a line.

An example cluster file follows:
# Excitement about the upcoming superbowl.  Played on February 1, 2009.
Super_Bowl_XLIII
Super_Bowl
Arizona_Cardinals
Kurt_Warner

# The US airways flight that ditched into the Hudson, with no casualties 
US_Airways_Flight_1549
Chesley_Sullenberger
Hudson_River
Airbus_A320_family

Usage
=====
./batch_eval.sh | ./tabularize.perl
./batch_eval_mturk.sh | ./tabularize.perl
./eval_mturk_mallet.sh | ./tabularize.perl

Scripts
=======
eval.py
	the evaluation script that use multiplicity B-cubed for overlapping clusters.

nonoverlapeval.py
	the previous version of the eval.py script for non-overlapping clusters.

tabularize.perl
	the script to tabularize the results of the eval.py script.

Batch evaluation scripts
------------------------
batch_eval.sh
	the scripts for evaluation of manual clusters against each other.

batch_eval_mturk.sh
	the scripts for evaluation of mechanical turk clusters against manual clusters.

eval_mturk_mallet.sh
	the script for evaluation of reprocessed mechanical turk clusters.
	The mechanical turk reponses are reprocessed using Mallet to form a new clusters.
	We reprocessed the reponses since the clusters based on the relatedness of artcile pairs did not work well.
