OBJECTS
* check the temporal gap in topics of newswire and WP articles.
* check which features contribute to find newsworthy articles.
* use mechanical turk to figure out 
    * what topics are interesting
    * and get more annotation (more development and evaluation (test) data set.
        * mapping WP articles <-> news articles. <-: Chris ->: Ben
            ->: Given the WP articles, which are the corresponding news articles? Or vice versa.
    * extract the first few sentences from each WP article, and 
* Draw better UIs for WikiTopics.
    * Chris's idea about it is more textual like McKeown's Newsblaster. I should draw a variety of possible UIs. We should write a CHI paper and we might consider hiring a company to develop a website for us (which is what Panos is doing.)

TO DOS
* Read Techo papers and send a question to Courtney

* Generate new 1000 popular articles for a new day in 2011, and annotate features, and see why they are popular: 
    * what are features?(binary) features: categories, # of edits, # increase in recent years, # edits in recent histories
    * Reprocess Wikistats
    * See which redirect table I can use.
    * Process data available.
    * Make a list of popular pages with features.
    * Use Korean language too.
?????* use links of WP articles as feature...

* Reprocess MTurk reponses about pair-wise relatedness of WP articles.
    
* SRILM
    * Learn how to build a LM and measure perplexity/entropy and KL-divergence.
    * measure the gap of the LMs between the newswire events and WT articles.
        * try my idea that the first day on which each topic appear must be important.

* stripping out news-specific words like BBC and so on.
    * find out words with high document frequency and feed them as stop words.
    * might not be worthwhile because we already use idf.

* sentence aligner

* WikiTrans
