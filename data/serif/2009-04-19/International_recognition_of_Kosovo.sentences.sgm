Kosovo's declaration of independence from Serbia was enacted on Sunday, 17 February 2008 by a unanimous quorum of the Assembly of Kosovo, with 109 in favour and with no opposition, with all 11 representatives of the Serb minority boycotting the proceedings.
International reaction was mixed, and the world community continues to be divided on the issue of the international recognition of Kosovo.
Background
As of 7 April 2009, 57 out of 192 sovereign United Nations member states have formally recognised the Republic of Kosovo as an independent state.
Notably, a majority of European Union member states have formally recognised Kosovo (22 out of 27).
24 out of 28 NATO member states have recognised Kosovo.
Of the four countries that border Kosovo, only Serbia refuses to recognise it.
On 27 February 2008, Germany became the first country to formalise its recognition of Kosovo by renaming its diplomatic office in Pristina as an embassy.
A number of states expressed concern over the unilateral character of Kosovo's declaration, or announced explicitly that they will not recognise an independent Kosovo.
The UN Security Council remains divided on this issue: of its five members with veto power, three (the United States, United Kingdom, France) have recognised the declaration of independence, while the People's Republic of China has expressed concern, urging the continuation of previous negotiation framework.
Russia has rejected the declaration and considers it illegal.
On 15 May 2008, Russia, China, and India released a joint statement where they called for new negotiations between the authorities of Belgrade and Pristina.
Although EU member states decide individually whether to recognise Kosovo, by consensus the EU has commissioned the European Union Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo (EULEX) to ensure peace and continued external oversight.
Due to the dispute in the UN Security Council, the reconfiguration of the UN Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) and partial handover to the EULEX mission met with difficulties.
In spite of Russian and Serbian protests, the UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon proceeded with the reconfiguration plan.
On 15 July 2008, he stated: "In the light of the fact that the Security Council is unable to provide guidance, I have instructed my Special Representative to move forward with the reconfiguration of UNMIK ... in order to adapt UNMIK to a changed reality".
According to the Secretary-General, the "United Nations has maintained a position of strict neutrality on the question of Kosovo's status".
On November 26, 2008, the UN Security Council gave the green light to the plan by Secretary General Ban Ki-moon on the deployment of the EULEX mission in Kosovo.
Under the plan, the EU mission is to assume police, justice and customs duties from the UN, while remaining neutral regarding Kosovo's status and operating under the 1244 resolution that first placed Kosovo under UN administration in 1999.
A UN General Assembly resolution adopted on 8 October 2008 backed the request of Serbia to seek an advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice on the legality of Kosovo's unilaterally proclaimed independence.
Out of 192 available votes, 77 were cast for, 6 against, 74 abstained and 35 were not cast at all.
Each vote represents one state.
As of late July 2008, UNMIK no longer provides the citizens of Kosovo with travel documents, while their ability to travel using the new Kosovan passport does not correlate with diplomatic recognition: for example Greece, Romania and Slovakia make it possible, while Senegal and Poland do not yet.
As of 9 October 2008, the three neighbouring states that recognise Kosovo—Albania, Montenegro and the Republic of Macedonia—all accept the Kosovan passport, which Serbia refuses.
Serbia's reaction
Serbia claims Kosovo as part of its sovereign territory.
Among its reactions, Serbia recalled its ambassadors from countries that recognised Kosovo for consultations for several months, indicted the Kosovar leaders on charges of high treason, and announced plans to litigate the case at the International Court of Justice.
Serbia also expelled ambassadors from countries that recognised Kosovo after the vote in the United Nations General Assembly in which the initiative of Serbia to seek an advisory opinion by the International Court of Justice was adopted.
Positions taken by states
States which formally recognise Kosovo as independent
UN member states
Non-UN member states
States which do not recognise Kosovo as independent
UN member states
Non-UN member states
Positions taken by intergovernmental organisations
Under international law, intergovernmental organisations do not themselves possess the legal capacity to diplomatically recognise any state; their member states do so individually.
However, depending on the intergovernmental organisation's rules of internal governance and the positions of their member states, they may express positive or negative opinions as to declarations of independence, or choose to offer or withhold membership to a newly-declared state.
Positions taken by non-state actors
Autonomous regions and secessionist movements
International non-governmental organisations
International Court of Justice advisory opinion proceedings
On 26 March 2008 Government of Serbia announced its intention to litigate at the  International Court of Justice (ICJ) the legality of the unilateral declaration of independence by Kosovo.
On 15 August 2008 Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremić filed a request at the United Nations, seeking the General Assembly's referral to the ICJ for an advisory opinion in the matter.
On 30 September 2008, in a trial vote, Serbian initiative was backed by 120 member states.
Eventually, a full vote was conducted on 8 October 2008.
This time 77 member states backed the initiative.
The resulting adopted UN GA resolution, designated  A/63/L.2, states:
Reflecting on the goals and principles of the UN, bearing in mind the functions and power in line with the UN Charter, we recall that on February 17, 2008 the provisional institutions of self-government of Kosovo proclaimed independence from the Republic of Serbia.
Aware that this act was received differently by UN members in relation to its harmonisation with the existing legal order,
We decide to request from the ICJ, in line with Article 96 of the UN Charter and Article 65 of the ICJ Statute, to give an advisory opinion on the following question:
"Is the unilateral declaration of independence by provisional institutions of self-government in Kosovo in accordance with international law?
"
On 17 October 2008, the ICJ made an Order organising the proceedings.
In its Order, the Court decided that the United Nations and its Member States as well as the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government of Kosovo as the authors of the declaration in question are considered likely to be able to furnish information on the question submitted to the Court.
It has fixed 17 April 2009 as the time-limit within which written statements on the question may be presented to the Court and 17 July 2009 as the time-limit within which States and organisations having presented written statements may submit written comments on the other statements.
