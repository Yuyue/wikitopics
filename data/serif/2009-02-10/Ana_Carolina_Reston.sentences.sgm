Ana Carolina Reston Macan (June 4, 1985 – November 15, 2006) was a Brazilian fashion model.
Reston was born to a middle-class family in Jundiaí, on the outskirts of São Paulo, Brazil.
At the age of 13 she began her modeling career after winning a local beauty contest in her hometown.
She was represented by renowned modeling agencies such as Ford, Elite and L'Équipe in countries such as China, Turkey, Mexico, and Japan, including prestigious ad campaigns such as Giorgio Armani.
In January 2004 Reston made her first overseas trip to Guangzhou,  China city.
While attending a casting call there, she was reportedly informed that she was 'too fat', a criticism, it has been said, that led to her decline into anorexia nervosa.
At the time of her death Reston weighed only 40 kilograms (88 lb), measured 172 cm (5 feet 8 inches), and had been hospitalized since October 25 for kidney malfunction due to anorexia and bulimia nervosa, which included a diet consisting only of apples and tomatoes.
She had a body mass index (BMI) of about 13.4, below the index value of 16 which the World Health Organization considers to be starvation.
Her condition became more serious and deteriorated into generalized infection that led to her death at the age of 21.
Reston was the second model reported to die from anorexia-related complications in 2006.
Luisel Ramos, a 22-year-old Uruguayan model, suffered a heart attack in August after living on lettuce leaves and Diet Coke for three months.
