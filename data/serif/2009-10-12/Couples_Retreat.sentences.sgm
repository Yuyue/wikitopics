Plot
Jason (Jason Bateman) and Cynthia (Kristen Bell) are dangerously close to getting a divorce.
In a last ditch effort to save their marriage, they decide to take a vacation to a tropical resort meant to help ailing couples through therapy.
Short on cash, they enlist help from their friends to offset the cost through a group rate: the kid-raising Dave (Vince Vaughn) and Ronnie (Malin Akerman), the lovelessly married Joey (Jon Favreau) and Lucy (Kristen Davis), and the recently divorced Shane (Faizon Love) and his much younger girlfriend Trudy (Kali Hawk).
The three other couples think they are just going to have fun and help their friends, but they realize they are in for having their relationships examined as well.
