Terminator Salvation is an upcoming American science fiction post-apocalyptic war film set for release on June 4, 2009 in Australia, June 3, 2009 in the UK and May 21, 2009 in the United States.
Directed by McG, it is the fourth film in the Terminator series and stars Christian Bale as John Connor and Sam Worthington as Marcus Wright, a cyborg who believes he is human.
It also introduces a young version of the first film's hero, Kyle Reese, played by Anton Yelchin, and depicts the origins of the T-800 Model 101 Terminator, played by Arnold Schwarzenegger and Roland Kickinger.
Being both a sequel and a prequel to the previous films, Salvation, set in 2018, focuses on the war between humanity and Skynet.
It abandons the format of previous entries in the series, which only revolved around Terminators and various other characters traveling through time to either kill or protect John Connor before the events of Judgment Day unfold.
It is the first film in the series to receive the PG-13 certificate in the USA, and the second to receive a 12A certificate in the UK.
Premise
On May 1, 2009, Warner Bros. released the following plot summary for the film:
At the beginning, John does not start off as leader of the human resistance, but will work his way through the ranks in the film.
He is mistrusted by other soldiers due to his extensive knowledge of Skynet.
McG said that the film will reveal the development of the Model 101 Terminator as well: scenes involve humans being captured and studied by Skynet in order to perfect their cybernetic organisms and John explaining "[i]f we let these things go online, the war is over".
Skynet tries to kill Kyle Reese because it is aware that Reese is John's father, and uses him as a bait in an attempt to kill John.
Cast
Christian Bale as John Connor: A soldier in the Resistance waging war against Skynet after it destroyed much of humanity in a nuclear holocaust, who is destined to become humanity's leader.
Director McG deemed Bale "the most credible action star in the world" during development.
McG wanted Bale for Marcus, but the actor–for reasons he "can't really remember why"–wanted to play Connor, and that led to the character's role getting expanded in rewrites of the script.
Bale was the first person to be cast and signed on for the role in November 2007.
McG talked extensively with Bale in the UK about the role while the latter was filming The Dark Knight, and they both agreed to proceed.
Although a fan of the Terminator series, he was at first uninterested, until McG convinced him the story would be character-based and not rely on special effects.
They kept working on the story every day, along with Worthington.
McG said Bale broke his hand punching a Terminator prop during filming.
Bale also spent six to eight hours each day with McG in the editing room to advise the finished product.
Sam Worthington as Marcus Wright: A resistance soldier who is plagued by vague memories and is discovered to be a decommissioned Terminator.
His last memory is of being on death row, and John is unsure of whether Wright is from the past or from the future.
Terminator creator James Cameron personally recommended Worthington (whom he directed in Avatar) to McG.
Russell Crowe also recommended him to McG.
McG decided Worthington looked tougher than the "great many of today's [waify] young male actors".
Worthington recalled Cameron told him "the Terminator to make is the one with the war".
Worthington tore his intercostal muscles during the first weeks of filming, but he nevertheless insisted on performing his own stunts.
McG had originally asked Christian Bale to play the role, but the latter insisted on portraying John instead, and to expand the character's role.
The former once expressed interest in casting Daniel Day-Lewis or Josh Brolin in the part as well.
Brolin did talk to Bale and read a draft of the screenplay, which he found "interesting and dark, [but] ultimately, though, I didn't think it felt right".
Anton Yelchin as Kyle Reese: A teenage soldier and admirer of John Connor.
As portrayed by Michael Biehn in The Terminator, he was sent back in time to 1984 to protect Sarah Connor to ensure the survival of the human race, and fathered John with her.
Yelchin said he wanted to portray Reese as Biehn did and not make him appear weaker  because it was a younger version of the character.
The difference in his portrayal lies in showing Reese as intense, but not concentrated until he joins the resistance proper.
Yelchin tried to convey Reese's intensity by focusing on how fast Biehn appeared when running in the original film.
Bryce Dallas Howard as Kate Connor: John's wife, who is seven months pregnant.
Charlotte Gainsbourg was originally set to play the part, but left due to scheduling conflicts with another film.
As portrayed by Claire Danes in the third film, Kate was a veterinarian; but in this film, she is now a physician.
Howard suggested, as part of the character's backstory, that Kate studied medical books and interviewed many surviving doctors after the events of Judgment Day.
The film's subject matter reminded her of developing countries, devastated by war and lack basic supplies such as clean water, which "reflect[s] things that are going on currently in this privileged world that we're living in where there hasn't been an apocalypse and robots haven't taken over the world.
I think that's something definitely for us to reinvestigate and that we continue to make choices for our own future to take that into consideration".
Howard also focused on Kate "being accustomed to fear and loss" because the character was a military brat.
Moon Bloodgood as Blair Williams: A "no-nonsense and battle-hardened" lead pilot in the resistance suffering from survivor guilt.
She will apparently be a romantic interest for Marcus.
Common as Barnes: A resistance soldier and John's right-hand man.
Helena Bonham Carter as Dr. Serena Kogan: The lead villain of the film, and a Terminator hybrid.
Before Judgement Day, Serena was an ex-Cyberdyne scientist with terminal cancer working on advanced technology, convincing Marcus to donate his body to Project Angel for her "research," for which will fall into the hands of Skynet.
Tilda Swinton was originally considered for the part, but Carter replaced her before filming.
She accepted the part because her boyfriend, Tim Burton, is a Terminator fan.
Her role was a "small but pivotal" one and would only require ten days of shooting.
On August 22, 2008, Carter delayed filming by a day, and was given an indefinite leave due to the death of four of her family members in a minibus accident in South Africa.
Arnold Schwarzenegger and Roland Kickinger as the T-800 Model 101: The first Terminator covered in living human tissue built as Skynet's newest weapon for the extermination of humankind.
Schwarzenegger will reprise his role via ADR and CGI facials, while the Austrian bodybuilder Kickinger, who previously portrayed Schwarzenegger in the 2005 biographical film See Arnold Run, was his double on set, for which a mold of the former — from 1983 — was scanned to create Kickinger's digital resemblance to the actor.
When asked about his role, Kickinger said it's "Arnold's character in the first Terminator.
That's basically my role, but 20 years before, so it establishes how the Terminator [came] about".
Polish strongman athlete Mariusz Pudzianowski was also considered for doubling Schwarzenegger.
Additional cast members include Brian Steele as a T-600, Jadagrace as Star, a girl in Reese's care, Chris Ashworth as Richter, Chris Browning as Morrison, Michael Ironside as General Ashdown, the resistance leader before John, Jane Alexander as Virginia, and Terry Crews.
Linda Hamilton has been confirmed to reprise her role as Sarah Connor in a voice over that opens the movie; they are from tapes Sarah recorded before her death prior to the film's events to warn John of the future war.
Production
Development
In 1999, two years after C2 Pictures purchased the rights to the franchise, two Terminator films' premise were mapped out and were supposed to be developed simultaneously.
Tedi Sarafian was hired to write Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, which he eventually received story credits for, while David C. Wilson was to write Terminator 4.
Before any revisions were done, T3 initially took place in 2001 and revolved around the first attacks between Skynet and humans.
T4 would follow immediately afterwards and centered primarily on the war seen in the first two movies.
Following the release of Terminator 3 in 2003, producers Andrew G. Vajna and Mario Kassar contracted Nick Stahl and Claire Danes to return as John Connor and Kate Brewster in another film.
Director Jonathan Mostow supervised the script by John D. Brancato and Michael Ferris, and was set to begin production in 2005 after completing another film.
It was known by then Arnold Schwarzenegger's role would be limited having assumed office as Governor of California.
The producers sought to have Warner Bros. finance the picture as they did for Terminator 3.
In 2005, Stahl said Connor and Brewster would be recast as the story jumped forward in time.
By 2006, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, distributor of the original film The Terminator, was set to distribute the fourth film as part of the new CEO Harry Sloan's scheme to make the studio a viable Hollywood player again.
On May 9, 2007, it was announced that production rights to the Terminator series had passed from the feuding Vajna and Kassar to the Halcyon Company.
The producers hoped to start a new trilogy based on the franchise.
By July 19, the project was in legal limbo due to a lawsuit between MGM and Halcyon subsidiary T Asset.
MGM had an exclusive window of 30 days to negotiate for distribution of the Terminator films.
When negotiating for Terminator 4, Halcyon rejected their initial proposal, and MGM suspended negotiations.
After the 30 days were over, MGM claimed that the period during which negotiations were suspended did not count and their exclusive period was still open.
Halcyon asked a court for an injunction allowing them to approach other distributors.
WB was able to obtain North American distribution rights, while Sony Pictures Entertainment will distribute the film overseas.
Writing
McG signed on to direct as the first two films were among his favorites, and he had even cast Robert Patrick (who played the T-1000) in his films.
Though he was initially unsure about "flogging a dead horse," he felt the post-apocalyptic setting allowed the film to be different enough so to not be an inferior sequel.
The idea that events in Terminator 2: Judgment Day and Terminator 3 altered the future also allowed them to be flexible with their presentation of the futuristic world.
McG met with the series' co-creator James Cameron, and, although he neither blessed nor cursed the project, Cameron told the new director he had faced a similar challenge when following Ridley Scott's Alien with Aliens.
He maintained two elements of the previous films; that John is an outsider to the authorities, and someone of future importance is being protected, and in this film it is Kyle Reese.
The first full screenplay for the film was written by Terminator 3 writers John Brancato and Michael Ferris, who received full screenplay credit.
Paul Haggis rewrote Brancato and Ferris's script, and Shawn Ryan made another revision three weeks before filming.
Jonathan Nolan also wrote on set, which led to McG characterizing his work on the script as the most important; he chose to contribute to the film after Bale signed on and created Connor's arc of becoming a leader.
Anthony E. Zuiker contributed to the script as well.
So extensive were the rewrites that Alan Dean Foster decided to rewrite the entire novelization after submitting it to his publisher, because the compiled shooting script was very different from the one he was given beforehand.
"You survived the nuclear holocaust and you crawl out of the hole after three-to-five years and say, 'Well, I know what's going on — I'm the one!
' Some SAS guy isn't going to say, 'Where do I go, boss?
' He'd say, 'Shut the fuck up and get in line.
— McG on John's struggles to become the leader.
In the early script drafts, John was a secondary character.
Producer James Middleton explained "Ben-Hur was influenced by Jesus Christ, but it was his story.
Much in that way, this [new main] character will be influenced by John Connor".
The original ending was to have John killed, and his image kept alive by the resistance by grafting his skin onto Marcus' cybernetic body.
However, after the Internet leak, Warner Bros. decided to completely change the entire third act of the film.
McG and Nolan did continue the Christ element of Connor's character though, in which he has some followers who believe what he knows about Skynet, and others who do not.
McG described the film's theme as "where you draw the line between machines and humans".
The friendship between Marcus — who was treated wrongly when humanity still ruled the world — and Kyle Reese illustrates how war and suffering can bring out the best in people, such as when they worked together to survive during the Blitz.
The title was derived from this second chance given to humanity and to Marcus, in addition to Connor's efforts to save humanity from the machines.
The film's original title was Terminator Salvation: The Future Begins, but this was dropped during filming.
Throughout writing, the cast and crew would watch scenes from the three films to pick moments to reference or tribute, including "I'll be back," which is uttered by Connor in this film.
McG found himself having to decide which ideas for references would be included and which would not.
An opening scene has Connor fighting a Terminator on a crashed helicopter, which was storyboarded as a homage to the climax of the original film, where his mother Sarah, having broken her leg, is chased by a crippled Terminator.
McG did this to reflect the skills Connor learned from her.
Filming and design
Shooting of the film started on May 5, 2008 in New Mexico.
Filming also took place at Kirtland Air Force Base in the state.
The filmmakers had originally intended to begin filming on April 15 in Budapest, but a new twenty-five percent tax rebate and absence of an interest rate cap and floor made the filmmakers seek the cheaper New Mexico, because of their $200 million budget.
To avoid delays caused by a possible 2008 Screen Actors Guild strike in July, all exterior scenes were completed by then, so production could restart easily.
The shoot ended on August 22, 2008, though some pick-ups took place in January 2009.
In addition to Bale breaking his hand and Worthington hurting his back, special effects technician Mike Menardis almost lost his leg filming an explosion.
The sequence required a manhole being blown into the air, which hit Menardis and partially severed his leg.
McG noted it was testament to the gritty style of the film.
"I say with respect, I didn't want that Star Wars experience of everything's a blue screen, tennis balls, and go for it.
I had Stan Winston build all the machines.
We built all the sets, the explosive power, the explosive power so you feel that wind and that percussion and that heat blowing your eyebrows off.
And with that you get a couple bumps and bruises on the way, but you get it in an integrity and a realism that hopefully echoes Apocalypse Now.
You couldn't say, 'Let's just shoot Apocalypse Now in Burbank, I think it's going to feel just as good.
The film used Technicolor's Oz process during post-production.
This is a partial silver retention on the interpositive, similar to bleach bypass, which will be used to lend to the sense of detachment from the modern world McG was looking for.
The filmmakers consulted with many scientists about the effects of an abandoned world and nuclear winter.
McG cited Mad Max 2, the original Star Wars trilogy and Children of Men, as well as the novel The Road, as his visual influences.
He instructed his cast to read the latter as well as Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?
Like Children of Men, McG would storyboard scenes so that it would be edited together to resemble a seamless, continuous shot.
The majority of the machines were designed by Martin Laing, a crew member on Cameron's Titanic and Ghosts of the Abyss.
McG described many of the machines as having a H. R. Giger influence.
McG's intent was to create a gritty, tactile 2018 on screen, and Laing concurred the robots would have to be black and degraded as none of them are new.
Laing devised Aerostats, which are smaller versions of the Aerial Hunter Killers from the previous films.
These Aerostats send a signal to the 60 feet tall humanoid Harvesters.
They are very big and slow, so they utilize Mototerminators to capture humans, and the Harvesters place them in Transporters.
Laing was unsure of how to design the Transporters until he saw a cattle transport while driving through Albuquerque.
Completing Skynet's domination of air, land and sea is the Hydrobot, which Laing modelled on eels.
The film features the rubber-skinned T-600s and T-700s.
McG interpreted Kyle Reese's description in the original film of the T-600 as being easy to spot by making them tall and bulky.
Salvation was one of the last films Winston, the visual effects supervisor on the first three films, worked on.
He died on June 15, 2008 from multiple myeloma, and McG will dedicate the film to him.
John Rosengrant and Charlie Gibson replaced Winston, and McG commented that they are "trying to achieve something that's never been done before" and will "push the envelope".
Motion capture was used to show damage to the Terminator Marcus' face, while a 20 foot tall model was used for the explosion of a 30-story building.
During filming, Bale became angry at director of photography Shane Hurlbut, swearing at him and threatening to leave the film; audio of the incident was leaked in February 2009.
Bale apologized publicly and said he resolved his differences with Hurlbut, and that when the incident took place they continued to film for a few hours.
Music
Danny Elfman began composing the score in January 2009.
Beforehand, McG had the idea to hire Gustavo Santaolalla, who he got to speak with, to work on the human themes, while having either Thom Yorke or Jonny Greenwood for Skynet's themes.
He also wanted to discuss scoring the film with Hans Zimmer, but he was unable to arrange a meeting.
However, he managed to meet with The Terminator and Terminator 2 composer Brad Fiedel.
McG was not interested in repeating the sounds Fiedel achieved in his films but still wanted Elfman to use those themes and ambient sounds, and give them a "Wagnerian quality".
Reprise Records will release the soundtrack on May 19, 2009, which will include fifteen tracks.
Alice in Chains' "Rooster" is among the featured songs, while Common has expressed interest in writing a song for the soundtrack.

Lawsuit
In March 2009, producer Moritz Borman filed a lawsuit against the Halcyon Company, seeking $160 million.
Borman, who had arranged the transfer of the Terminator rights to Halcyon in May 2007, stated the company's two managers Derek Anderson and Victor Kubicek had "hijacked" the production and refused to give him his $2.5 million share of the production.
Borman alleged budget overruns were the reasons Anderson and Kubicek did not pay him and that they had $1 million in debt.
Nevertheless, an "amicable" resolution was reached a month later.
Release
The film will be released in the U.S. on May 21, 2009 with Warner Bros. setting the American premiere on May 14, 2009 at the Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood.
Elsewhere, Sony Pictures Entertainment will be releasing the film in most overseas territories on different dates on June.
One exception is Mexico, however, because of the swine flu outbreak in the country, which forced Sony to push the release date to July 31, 2009.
It is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association of America for intense sequences of sci-fi violence and action, and language, unlike the previous R-rated films.
The decision was made to rate the film PG-13 after agreeing to cut out a shot of Marcus stabbing a thug with a screwdriver, as McG felt disallowing the young audience due to that one shot was unfair.
He also deleted a topless scene for Moon Bloodgood because "It was a soft moment between a man and a woman that was designed to echo the Kelly McGillis/Harrison Ford moment in Witness [but] in the end, it felt more like a gratuitous moment of a girl taking her top off in an action picture, and I didn't want that to convolute the story or the characters".
The producers had expected the rating because of the modern leniency towards violence in PG-13 films, such as Live Free or Die Hard.
In addition to the novelization by Alan Dean Foster, a prequel novel entitled From the Ashes by Timothy Zahn was released.
IDW Publishing released a four-issue prequel comic, as well as an adaptation.
It follows Connor rallying together the resistance in 2017, as well as examining normal people overcoming their intolerances to defeat Skynet.
Playmates Toys, Sideshow Collectibles, Character Options, and DC Unlimited will produce merchandise, while Chrysler and 7-Eleven are among the product placement partners.
A roller coaster will open at Six Flags Magic Mountain.
A video game of the same name will coincide with the release of the film.
The game will be a third-person shooter.
Christian Bale declined to lend his voice.
The game will, however, feature the voices of Common and Moon Bloodgood as Barnes and Blair Williams, respectively.
Rose McGowan will voice the character of Angie Salter, despite not appearing in the film.
At the 2009 Spanish Formula One Grand Prix in Barcelona, the Brawn GP cars of Jenson Button and Rubens Barrichello sported prominent Terminator Salvation sponsorship on the rear wing, a one-time only arrangement to promote the film ahead of its release.
After qualifying on pole position, Button went on to win while Barrichello finished second and set the fastest lap of the race.
