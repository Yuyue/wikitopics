Ben Collins is 'The Stig'
In 2004, Ben Collins made an appearance during the fourth season of BBC Top Gear, alongside skydiving parachutist Tim Carter.
The stunt involved Carter and an aerial cameraman jumping out of a Cessna light aircraft then landing in the open-topped Mercedes car being driven at speed by Collins.
In 2005, the driver featured during series five, driving a Lancer Evo VII and then a Bowler Wildcat vehicle in a rally race against mountain boarding world champion Tom Kirkman.
At the start of series six, Collins appeared with other British Touring Car Championship racing and stunt drivers for a Five-a-side football game using a fleet of Toyota Aygo cars.
Collins played in a team captained by Top Gear presenter Richard Hammond.
The other drivers were Paul Swift, Tim Harvey and Tom Chilton (blue); playing against James May, Russ Swift, Matt Neal, Dan Eaves and Rob Huff (red).
On a separate occasion, following an accident involving Richard Hammond in September 2006, the Health & Safety Executive report into the event recorded that Collins had "worked closely with Top Gear as a high performance driver and consultant" and had prepared a briefing for Richard Hammond preceding the event.
Regular role
On 19 January 2009, British newspaper The Daily Telegraph ran a story claiming that they had "outed" Collins as being one of the people behind the white-suited incarnation of the Stig, at the same time noting that "Collins, from Bristol, has always denied being The Stig".
The Times, in a follow-up article, stated that the "identity of the white-suited Stig ... has been an open secret within the motoring world for some years, with newspapers refraining from publishing his name, to uphold the spirit of the programme".
which concluded that "a newspaper broke with the convention to out Mr Collins, 33, after following up a story in a Bristol newspaper".
Two Bristol-based local newspapers had published articles a week earlier, on the basis of information leaked from a local art-gallery.
Collins had previously commissioned a Clifton-based father and son business in September 2008, to produce a limited-edition run of 450 poster prints to be sold on at a price of Â£318 each..  Collins had initially portrayed himself as a BBC marketing executive and only confirmed a more detailed connection to the Top Gear character after the signing of confidentiality agreements by the business owners.
The signed poster image showed a salt flat scene, with The Stig positioned standing on it.
However, Top Gear presenter James May claimed that the Stig's identity has not been outed and there has been speculation that there may be more than one person to be the Stig.
