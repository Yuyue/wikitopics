Pageants
Prejean competed in the Miss California Teen USA 2005 pageant and placed first runner-up to Stephanie Brink.
In 2007, she competed in the Miss California USA 2008 pageant and initially placed third runner-up; later a judging error was discovered and she was promoted to first runner-up.
Prejean returned the following year and won the Miss California USA 2009 title, succeeding Raquel Beezley as California's representative to the Miss USA pageant.
She had received breast implants paid for by the Miss California Pageant a few weeks before.
Prejean competed at the nationally televised Miss USA 2009 pageant in Las Vegas, Nevada on April 19, 2009 and placed first runner-up.
Prejean's answer to her final question during the pageant became the subject of controversy.
Miss USA 2009 controversy
Prejean gained nationwide attention over her answer to a question about same-sex marriage.
During the 2009 Miss USA pageant, Prejean was asked by pageant judge Perez Hilton whether she believed every U.S. state should legalize same-sex marriage.
She responded, "Well I think it's great that Americans are able to choose one way or the other.
We live in a land where you can choose same-sex marriage or opposite marriage.
You know what, in my country, in my family, I do believe that marriage should be between a man and a woman, no offense to anybody out there.
But thatâ€™s how I was raised and I believe that it should be between a man and a woman".
Hilton called Prejean's answer "the worst in pageant history" and he also told ABC News that she lost the crown because of it.
He stated as well that "There are various other ways she could have answered that question and still stayed true to herself without alienating millions of people".
Prejean believes that the opinion that she expressed in the answer cost her the crown.
Prejean stated that she was told by Miss California USA pageant officials that "You need to not talk about your faith" and was pressured to apologize for her statement.
A spokesperson for the Miss California Pageant denied these claims and accused Prejean of lying.
Donald Trump, who owns most of the Miss Universe Organization, defended Prejean's answer, saying that "Miss California has done a wonderful job" and that "It wasn't a bad answer, that was simply her belief".
He then added that the question was "a bit unlucky" and that no matter which way she answered the question "she was going to get killed".
Several elected officials and political pundits criticized Hilton and defended Prejean for honestly stating her personal beliefs.
Gavin Newsom, mayor of San Francisco and a prominent supporter of same-sex marriage, also defended Prejean.
Post-Miss USA Pageant
Events
Following the pageant, Prejean appeared in a television advertisement for the National Organization for Marriage's campaign against gay marriage, which had contacted her shortly after the pageant.
She also hired a Christian public relations firm.
In late April, Prejean presented an award at the Gospel Music Association's 2009 Dove Awards in Nashville, Tennessee.
On May 1, Prejean stated on On the Record w/ Greta Van Susteren that she did not have an opinion on civil unions for same-sex couples, but that she supports rights of same-sex couples, such as hospital visitations.
She has stated that she would be willing to meet with representatives from California's largest gay rights group "as long as it's not political".
Photograph controversy
On May 4, 2009, a photograph of Prejean partially nude with her back turned to the camera appeared on a celebrity gossip blog.
The directors of the Miss California USA pageant are investigating Prejean for potentially violating a contract clause against prospective pageant candidates having been photographed "nude or partially nude".
Prejean stated on May 5 that she had posed for that shot as a seventeen-year-old model and that she sees no problem with it, saying that "I am a Christian, and I am a model.
Models pose for pictures, including lingerie and swimwear photos.
Recently, photos taken of me as a teenager have been released surreptitiously to a tabloid Web site that openly mocks me for my Christian faith.
I am not perfect, and I will never claim to be".
She also objected to its current release.
She has also stated that she was "naive, and young" at the time of the photography and regrets having made the decision.
National Organization for Marriage president Maggie Gallagher stated on May 5 that the release would not affect Prejean's role.
She commented that "On a personal note, as a former unwed mother, I want to say to Americans: you don't have to be a perfect person to have the right to stand up for marriage".
Alicia Jacobs, a local reporter for KVBC in Las Vegas who served as a judge at the Miss USA pageant, has stated that the pictures "go beyond what the Miss California pageant says are appropriate," and do not befit Prejean's status.
