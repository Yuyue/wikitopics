X-Men Origins: Wolverine is a 2009 superhero film based on the Marvel Comics' fictional character Wolverine.
It was released on April 28, 2009 in the Netherlands and worldwide up to May 1 2009.
The film is directed by Gavin Hood and stars Hugh Jackman as the title character.
It is a prequel to the X-Men film trilogy and is primarily set roughly ten to seventeen years before the film X-Men.
The film focuses on the violent past of mutant Wolverine and his time with Team X, before Wolverine's skeleton was bonded with the indestructible metal adamantium.
The plot also details his early encounters with Colonel William Stryker (Danny Huston), the Weapon X program, Wolverine's interactions with other mutants and his complex relationship with his half-brother Victor Creed (Liev Schreiber).
The film was mostly shot in Australia and New Zealand.
Wolverine was released to mixed reviews; critics praised Hugh Jackman's performance, but considered the film and its screenplay a little disappointment.
It opened at the top of the box office, grossing $85.1 million domestically on the opening weekend, and has grossed over $200 million worldwide as of May 10, 2009.
Plot
In 1845 Canada, young James Howlett sees his father killed by groundskeeper Thomas Logan.
The trauma activates the boy's mutation: bone claws protrude from James' hands, and in a mindless rage he kills Logan.
With his dying breath, Logan tells James that he is his real father.
James flees but is confronted by Logan's abused son and James' half-brother Victor Creed.
James and Victor run away, with Victor vowing that they will look out for each other.
With their powerful healing abilities, the two survive for over a century as men in their prime, living out their violent urges together in the American Civil War and both World Wars.
During the Vietnam War, Victor kills his superior after the superior stops Victor from raping a young girl.
James defends his brother and the two are executed by firing squad, which they survive.
Major William Stryker approaches the two and offers them membership in Team X, a group of mutants that includes marksman Agent Zero, mercenary Wade Wilson, teleporter John Wraith, invincible Fred Dukes and electricity-controlling Chris Bradley.
The brothers agree and participate in a raid on an African diamond trafficker to retrieve a meteorite.
The meteorite leads the team to a village, which Stryker orders destroyed after the villagers refuse to help.
James is disgusted by the massacre and leaves the group.
Six years later, James - now going by the name of his father, Logan - lives in Canada with his girlfriend Kayla Silverfox.
Stryker, now a colonel, locates Logan and warns him someone is killing members of the team, with Bradley and Wade already dead.
Shortly afterward Victor murders Silverfox.
Logan battles his half-brother, but is defeated.
Stryker offers Logan a way to beat Victor, as the rogue mutant is dangerous to Stryker's career.
Logan undergoes an operation to reinforce his skeleton with adamantium, a virtually indestructible metal retrieved from the meteorite.
Before the procedure, Logan asks for new dog tags inscribed with "Wolverine", based on a story Kayla told him.
After the procedure, Stryker orders Wolverine's memory to be erased, but Wolverine overhears him and flees.
Wolverine takes refuge in the barn of an elderly couple who take Logan in for the night.
In the morning Zero kills the couple and pursues a fleeing Wolverine, but Logan ends up killing him.
Wolverine locates Wraith and Dukes and asks them about the location of Stryker's new laboratory, referred to as, "the Island".
They explain that after Logan left Team X they began capturing mutants, and that Victor, who still works for Stryker, is continuing their work.
Stryker is performing experiments on the mutants on the Island, hoping to duplicate abilities, but one of them, Remy LeBeau (also known as Gambit), escaped and knows the location of the Island.
Wraith and Wolverine locate Gambit and Wolverine asks for the location of the Island, vowing to destroy it.
Gambit suspects Wolverine was sent to recapture him and attacks.
Outside, Victor, learning his brother's location from Dukes, kills Wraith and takes a sample of his blood.
Wolverine attacks and almost kills Victor, but Gambit interrupts the fight, inadvertently letting Victor escape.
After a struggle with Wolverine, Gambit realizes he was honest and flies him to the mutant prison on Three Mile Island.
Wolverine confronts Stryker, learning that Silverfox is still alive, having faked her death with hydrochlorothiazide.
Silverfox, a mutant with the powers of persuasion, kept track of Wolverine in order to free her sister, Emma Frost.
Wolverine forgoes his path of revenge and leaves the facility.
Victor shows up, but is denied the adamantium bonding.
Enraged at this proof of Logan's superiority, Victor tries to kill Kayla, but Logan, hearing her screams, stops him.
Despite Victor's encouragement, Logan spares him, denying his feral nature, and agrees to help Kayla free the imprisoned mutants.
Panicking, Stryker activates his newest creation, Weapon XI, a surgically altered Wade Wilson with the abilities of other mutants, designed to be the "ultimate mutant killer".
Weapon XI attacks Wolverine and the escaped mutants, which results in Silverfox being shot.
The mutants escape through the facility's tunnels, guided by a young Scott Summers who is following a voice in his head.
Outside, the party is greeted by Professor Charles Xavier, who guided Scott and offers them shelter at his school.
The fight between Wolverine and Weapon XI spills onto the top of one of the plant's cooling towers, where Victor arrives and aids his brother (claiming no one will kill James but him).
Together, they decapitate Weapon XI.
Wolverine informs Victor that despite his help, their relationship is over.
Victor simply reminds him that as brothers, they can never be finished, and escapes.
Wolverine is saved from the collapsing tower by Gambit.
Logan asks Gambit to ensure the mutants' safety while he finds Kayla.
As he carries her to safety, Stryker shoots Wolverine in the back and head with adamantium bullets, knocking him unconscious.
Silverfox uses her powers to order Stryker to walk away before dying from her injuries.
Gambit returns, but due to amnesia caused by the brain damage inflicted by the bullets, Wolverine does not remember anything.
As ambulances and police arrive, Gambit tries to convince Wolverine to come with him, but he declines.
Gambit wishes Wolverine good luck before they depart.
Stryker is found and arrested by the military for killing a general in Three Mile Island.
Cast
Hugh Jackman as James Howlett / Logan / Wolverine: The mutant and future X-Men member.
Jackman, who played Wolverine in the previous films, has also become producer of the film via his company Seed Productions, and earned $25 million for the film.
Jackman underwent a high intensity weight training regimen to bulk up for his role.
He changed the program to shock the body into change and also performed cardiovascular workouts.
Jackman noted no digital touches were applied to his physique in a shot of him rising from the tank within which Wolverine has his bones coated in adamantium.
Troye Sivan as Young James Howlett: Casting directors cast Sivan as the young Wolverine after seeing him sing at the Channel Seven Perth Telethon, and he was accepted after sending in an audition tape.
Kodi Smit-McPhee was originally cast in the role, when filming was originally beginning in December 2007, but he opted out to film The Road.
Liev Schreiber as Victor Creed: Logan's half-brother and fellow soldier.
Jackman and Hood compared Wolverine and Sabretooth's relationship to the Borg-McEnroe rivalry in the world of tennis: Victor hates him because he loved and needed his brother, but is too proud to admit he needs him back.
Tyler Mane, who played him in X-Men, had hoped to reprise the role.
Jackman worked with Schreiber before, in the 2001 romantic comedy Kate & Leopold with Meg Ryan and described him as having a competitive streak necessary to portray Sabretooth.
They "egged" each other on set to perform more and more stunts.
Schreiber put on   of muscle for the part, and described Sabretooth as the most monstrous role he ever played.
As a child, he loved the Wolverine comics because of their unique "urban sensibility".
Schreiber had studied to be a fight choreographer and wanted to be a dancer like Jackman, so he enjoyed working out their fight scenes.
Michael-James Olsen as Young Victor Creed: James's half-brother.
Danny Huston as William Stryker: Schreiber was originally in negotiations for the part, while Brian Cox, who played the character in X2, wanted to reprise the role.
He believed computer-generated imagery, similar to the program applied to Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen in the opening flashback of X-Men: The Last Stand, would allow him to appear as the younger Stryker.
Huston liked the complex Stryker, who "both loves and hates mutants because his son was a mutant and drove his wife to suicide.
So he understands what they're going through, but despises their destructive force".
He compared the character to a racehorse breeder, who rears his mutant experiments like children but abandons them when something goes wrong.
Lynn Collins as Kayla Silverfox: Wolverine's love interest and later captive of Stryker.
She has the powers of tactile telepathy/hypnosis.
Michelle Monaghan turned down the role because of scheduling conflicts, despite her enthusiasm to work with Jackman.
In the film, Silverfox is the sister of Emma Frost.
Taylor Kitsch as Remy LeBeau / Gambit: A Cajun thief who has the ability to charge any object he touches with kinetic energy, forcing it to explode.
The size of the object determines the magnitude of the resulting explosion.
He is also skilled in the use of a staff.
will.i.am as John Wraith: A teleporting mutant.
It is will.i.am's major film debut.
Although he initially did not get on with the casting director, he got the role because he wanted to play a mutant with the same power as Nightcrawler.
He enrolled in boot camp to get into shape for the part.
When filming a fight, he scarred his knuckles after accidentally punching and breaking the camera.
Kevin Durand as Fred J. Dukes / Blob: A mutant with an indestructible layer of skin and the ability to create his own gravitational field.
In the film's early sequences, he is a formidable fighting man but years later, due to a poor diet, has gained an enormous amount of weight.
Daniel Henney as Agent Zero: A member of the Weapon X program and an expert tracker with lethal marksman skills.
Dominic Monaghan as Bradley: A mutant who can manipulate electricity and a technopath.
It was originally reported that Monaghan was going to play Barnell Bohusk / Beak.
Tim Pocock as Scott Summers: A younger version of Scott Summers who will later become Cyclops and future leader of the X-Men.
He is shown as a weapon X captive as he is captured by Victor Creed.
He is freed by Wolverine and leads the weapon X captives to safety, guided by Professor Xavier telepathically.
He  has the power to emit powerful beams of energy from his eyes.
However, where in the comics and previous movies his eyes emit a beam of concussive force, in this film it appears that his eyes emit a heat as well, causing things to burn.
Tahyna Tozzi  as Emma Frost: A mutant with the power to turn her skin into diamond.
X2 writer Dan Harris said that Sigourney Weaver would have played Emma Frost in X-Men: The Last Stand if Bryan Singer had stayed on to direct.
The film depiction of Emma does not exhibit the character's traditional telepathic abilities.
Film credits list the character as "Kayla's sister/Emma" as opposed to "Emma Frost"; however, trailers and television ads identify her by full name as "Emma Frost".
Ryan Reynolds as Wade Wilson: A wisecracking mercenary with lethal swordsmanship skill and athleticism, who would later became Deadpool.
He was not actually a mutant until he underwent experimentations which gave him the same healing factor as Wolverine.
Reynolds had been interested in playing the character in his own film since 2003.
Originally, Reynolds was only going to cameo as Wilson but the role grew after he was cast..
Ryan Reynolds and Scott Adkins as Weapon XI/Deadpool: Weapon XI is the final antagonist of the film, having been genetically altered to be the ultimate mutant killer.
He has powers taken from other mutants killed or kidnapped in the film, as well as retractable blades in his arms.
In the comics, Weapon XI and Deadpool are two entirely different characters, but they decided to incorporate this new take into the film.
Ryan Reynolds portrays Weapon XI for close-ups, standing shots, and simple stunts while Scott Adkins is used for the more complicated and dangerous stunt work.
Peter O'Brien as John Howlett: James' alleged father, shot by Thomas Logan in the film's opening.
Alice Parkinson as Elizabeth Howlett: James' mother.
Aaron Jeffery as Thomas Logan: Victor and James' real father.
Max Cullen and Julia Blake as Travis Hudson and Heather Hudson: An elderly couple who take care of Wolverine after his adamantium bonding.
The Hudsons are heavily adapted from the comics' James MacDonald and Heather Hudson.
The film includes numerous cameo appearances of a younger versions of characters from the previous films, including characters in the film are Jason Stryker (William Stryker's lobotomized telepathic son whom he keeps on ice).
There was a cameo for a young Storm, which can be seen in the trailer, but it was cut out.
A digitally "de-aged" Patrick Stewart also makes an uncredited cameo as a younger Charles Xavier.
Xavier's facial features appear to be entirely digitally created.
The fact that he is not credited makes it conceivable that his "cameo" is actually an appearance by his digitable double.
Asher Keddie is in the film, and played Dr. Carol Frost.
Poker player Daniel Negreanu has a cameo.
Phil Hellmuth wanted to join him but was unable because he committed to an event in Toronto.
X-Men co-creator Stan Lee said he would cameo, but he was not in Australia during filming, so this will have to be a pick-up conducted during January 2009, though he was erroneously credited as "Lawnmower man" in the leaked work print (notable since the work print inexplicably has part of X-Men: The Last Stand's credits tacked on to it).
Production
Development
David Benioff, a comic book fan, pursued the project for almost three years before he was hired to write the script in October 2004.
In preparing to write the script, he reread Barry Windsor-Smith's "Weapon X" story, as well as Chris Claremont and Frank Miller's 1982 limited series on the character (his favorite storyline).
Jackman collaborated on the script, which he wanted to be more of a character piece compared with the previous X-Men films.
Benioff aimed for a "darker and a bit more brutal" story, writing it with an R rating in mind, although he acknowledged the film's final tone would rest with the producers and director.
Jackman did not see the need to make the film R.
Deadpool had been developed for his own film by Reynolds and David S. Goyer at New Line Cinema in 2003, but the project fell apart as they focused on Blade: Trinity and an aborted spin-off.
Benioff wrote the character into the script in a manner Jackman described as fun, but would also deviate from some of his traits.
Similarly, Gambit was a character who the filmmakers had tried to put in the previous X-Men films.
Jackman liked Gambit because he is a "loose cannon" like Wolverine, stating their relationship echoes that of Wolverine and Pyro in the original trilogy.
David Ayer contributed to the script.
Benioff finished his draft in October 2006, and Jackman stated there would be a year before shooting, as he was scheduled to start filming Australia (2008) during 2007.
Before the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike began, James Vanderbilt and Scott Silver were hired for a last-minute rewrite.
Gavin Hood was announced as director of the project in July 2007 for a 2008 release.
Previously, X-Men and X2 director Bryan Singer and X-Men: The Last Stand director Brett Ratner were interested in returning to the franchise, while Alexandre Aja and Len Wiseman also wanted the job.
Zack Snyder, who was approached for The Last Stand, turned down this film because he was directing Watchmen.
Jackman saw parallels between Logan and the main character in Tsotsi.
Hood explained that while he was not a comic book fan, he "realized that the character of Wolverine, I think his great appeal lies in the fact that he's someone who in some ways, is filled with a great deal of self-loathing by his own nature and he's constantly at war with his own nature".
The director described the film's themes as focusing on Wolverine's inner struggle between his animalistic savagery and noble human qualities.
Hood enjoyed the previous films, but set out to give the spin-off a different feel.
In October, Fox announced a May 1, 2009 release date and the X-Men Origins prefix.
Filming
Preliminary shooting took place at Fox Studios Australia (in Sydney) during late 2007.
Principal photography began on January 18, 2008 in New Zealand.
Locations included Dunedin.
Controversy arose as the Queenstown Lakes District Council disputed the Department of Labour's decision to allow Fox to store explosives in the local ice skating rink.
Fox moved some of the explosives to another area.
The explosives were used for a shot of the exploding Hudson Farm, a scene which required four cameras.
Jackman and Palermo's Woz Productions reached an agreement with the council to allow recycling specialists on set to advise the production on being environmentally friendly.
Filming continued at Fox (where most of the shooting was done) and New Orleans, Louisiana.
Cockatoo Island was used for Stryker's facility; the enormous buildings there saved money on digitally expanding a set.
Production of the film was predicted to generate $60 million in Sydney's economy.
Principal photography ended by May 23.
The second unit continued filming in New Zealand until March 23, and were scheduled to continue filming for two weeks following the first unit's wrap.
This included a flashback to Logan during the Normandy Landings, which was shot at Blacksmiths, New South Wales.
Hood and Fox disputed on the film's direction.
The studio had two replacements lined up before Richard Donner, husband of producer Lauren Shuler Donner, flew to Australia to ease on-set tensions.
Hood remarked, "Out of healthy and sometimes very rigorous debate, things get better.
[...] I hope the film's better because of the debates.
If nobody were talking about us, we'd be in trouble!
" Hood added he and Thomas Rothman were both "forceful" personalities in creative meetings but they had never had a "stand-up" argument.
Two weeks of pick-ups began on January 12, 2009, in Vancouver.
These included finishing scenes with Ryan Reynolds, who had been working on two other films during principal photography.
Shots were filmed at the University of British Columbia, Lord Byng Secondary School, and Kitsilano Secondary School.
Gavin Hood has announced that multiple "secret endings" exist for the film and that these endings will differ from print to print of the film.
Music
Composed by Harry Gregson-Williams with additional music by Halli Cauthery and Christopher Willis, the soundtrack for X-Men Origins: Wolverine was mixed by Malcolm Luker, engineered by Costa Kotselas and features Martin Tillman on the electric cello.
In a 2008 interview with Christopher Coleman of Tracksounds.com, Gregson-Williams said that Gavin Hood attracted him to the project, adding: "I happened to meet him at the Golden Globes dinner about three years ago.
That night we were both nominees, but both losers.
He had been nominated for Tsotsi and during the dinner I had spoken to him and he seemed like a really smart and creative guy...and into music.
So I was really delighted when I got a call to meet him and discuss the possibilities for Wolverine".
At the time of the interview, Gregson-Williams was already working on the score for Tony Scott's remake of The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3, but the earlier release date of X-Men Origins: Wolverine eventually led him to sidetrack that project, as well as the score for Pixar's upcoming G-Force.
In late March of 2009, Jon Burlingame of Variety was at the Newman Scoring Stage at 20th Century-Fox to listen and report on the recording of the score.
Gregson-Williams conducted "a 78-piece orchestra and a 40-voice choir (20 male, 20 female)" to achieve the sound.
At the time of his visit, Burlingame noted that the choir was singing "stanzas from an ancient Norse poem in Old Icelandic" to underscore what would be first track, "Logan Through Time".
Director Gavin Hood commented on Gregson-Williams' style, saying: "Harry's challenge is to give us operatic scale, but also keep it intimate and human.
Harry's music has a kind of muscular confidence and strength that is very useful for the action, but he also has tremendous soul".
Hood also called the recording performance "frigging brilliant!
"
Release
Leaked workprint
On March 31, 2009, a full length DVD-quality workprint of the film without a timecode or watermark, with some unfinished effects shots, a different typeface for titles and casting, alternate sound effects, and a temporary soundtrack in place for that of Harry Gregson-Williams', was leaked online.
The studio said it would be able to determine the source of the leak using forensic marks in the workprint.
The FBI and MPAA began investigating the illegal posting.
The print contained a reference to Rising Sun Pictures, an Australian visual effects company working on the film.
The company denied that they ever had a full copy of the film.
Executive producer Thomas Rothman noted the leaked version lacked the ten minutes added during pick-ups in January 2009.
However, the theatrical version of the film has no extra scenes that were not included in the leaked workprint.
Both versions run exactly 107 minutes, but director Gavin Hood said "another ending exists that features the film's villain".
Theatrical run
X-Men Origins: Wolverine was released on April 29, 2009 in the UK, Denmark, South Africa and Australia, Aprl 30, 2009 in the Philippines and in the Dominican Republic, May 1, 2009 in the United States and Canada.
A contest was held on the official website to determine the location of the world premiere on April 27.
Fans could vote for their town.
In the end, the Harkins at the Tempe Marketplace in Tempe, Arizona won the premiere.
The release in Mexico has been delayed for an unspecified period of time due to H1N1 flu.
Cinemagoers to Vue cinemas in the UK were able to see the film the day before release, by attending an 'X-Men Quadrilogy' screening event, with the film shown at approx 22:00 on the 28th April.
On April 22, nine days before the release of the film, it was reported that X-Men Origins: Wolverine was outselling Iron Man "3-to-1 at the same point in the sales cycle (nine days prior to the film’s release)".
During its first day of wide release, Wolverine took in an estimated $35 million, with almost $5 million of that from midnight showings.
That places the film as the 16th highest-grossing opening day ever (22nd with ticket-price inflation).
It went on to be #1 at the box office with a total of $85,000,000.
Among summer kick-offs, it ranked fifth behind The Dark Knight, Spider-Man 3, Spider-Man, and Iron Man and it was in the top ten of comic book adaptations.
The opening was lower than the last movie in the franchise, X-Men: The Last Stand, as well as X2, but higher than the first X-Men.
Wolverine has grossed over $130 million domestically and over $209 million worldwide as of May 10, 2009.
Critical reaction
The film was met with a mixed reception by critics.
Rotten Tomatoes currently reports a 37% rating--or 15% when filtered for their "Top Critics"--with 218 reviews (80 "fresh", 138 "rotten").
Metacritic reports a "metascore of 44 out of 100 from 34 critic reviews".
Comparatively, Yahoo!
Movies currently reports a grade of "C+" averaged from 13 critic reviews.
Richard Corliss of Time commented on the film's standing among other Marvel films, saying that it is "an O.K., not great, Marvel movie that tells the early story of the prime X-Man, and attempts to make it climax in a perfect coupling with the start of the known trilogy".
He also said that "superhero mythologies can be so complicated, only a lonely comic-book-reading kid could make sense of it all".
James Mullinger of GQ also commented on the structure of the story in saying that the "film clumsily tries to explain the origins of James [Howlett], AKA Wolverine, which had wisely only ever been briefly referred to in the original X-Men saga.
In doing so, it creates a fairly bland plot which is full of holes".
Roger Ebert gave the film two stars out of four and expressed his views on the title character: "Why should I care about this guy?
He feels no pain and nothing can kill him, so therefore he's essentially a story device for action sequences".
Comparatively, Bill Gibron of AMC's filmcritic website gave the film a positive "4.0 out of 5 stars," saying that although Hugh Jackman is "capable of carrying even the most mediocre effort, he singlehandedly makes X-Men Origins: Wolverine an excellent start to the summer 2009 season".
He did however predict that "there will be purists who balk at how Hood and his screenwriters mangle and manipulate the mythology;" and further said that "any ending which leaves several characters unexplained and unaccounted for can't really seal the full entertainment deal".
Regarding Wolverine within the context of the X-Men film series, Tom Charity of CNN commented: "Serviceable but inescapably redundant, this Wolverine movie does just enough to keep the X-Men franchise on life support, but the filmmakers will have to come up with some evolutionary changes soon if it's going to escape X-tinction".
Similarly, A. O. Scott of The New York Times expressed that "X-Men Origins: Wolverine will most likely manage to cash in on the popularity of the earlier episodes, but it is the latest evidence that the superhero movie is suffering from serious imaginative fatigue".
On a more negative note, Philip French of The Observer said that the film's "dull, bone-crushing, special-effects stuff" are "of interest only to hardcore fans who've probably read it all in Marvel comics".
Sukhdev Sandhu of The Daily Telegraph stated that "Wolverine is an artificial stimulus package of the most unsatisfying kind.
Aggressively advertised and hyped to the hills, it will no doubt attract full houses at first; after that though, when word-of-mouth buzz-kill goes into overdrive, there’s bound to be widespread deflation and a palpable feeling of being conned".
Similarly, Orlando Parfitt of IGN (UK) praised the performances of the actors and the action scenes, but stated that the film felt underdeveloped: "There's an enjoyable time to be had with Wolverine, but it's also somewhat unsatisfying".
Furthermore, Scott Mendelson of The Huffington Post gave the film a grade of "D," noting that "Wolverine was the lead character of [the X-Men] films, and we've already learned everything we need to know from the films in said franchise," adding that "the extra information given here actually serves to make the character of Logan/Wolverine less interesting".
Trevan McGee of Ink also commented on the supporting cast, saying "the movie bends over backward trying to inject as many cameos and secondary characters into the movie as possible.
The mutants invented for the movie are uninspired and boring..".
Video game
Raven Software developed a video game based on the film with the same name, which Activision Blizzard published.
Marc Guggenheim wrote the script, while Hugh Jackman, Liev Schreiber, and will.i.am voice their characters from the film.
Sequel
Hood speculated that there will be a sequel, which will be set in Japan.
As stated above, at the end credits scene, Logan is seen drinking at a Japanese bar.
Such a location was the subject of Claremont and Miller's series, which was not in the first film as Jackman felt “what we need to do is establish who [Logan] is and find out how he became Wolverine".
Jackman stated the Claremont-Miller series is his favorite Wolverine story.
Of the Japanese arc, Jackman also stated that, "there are so many areas of that Japanese story, I love the idea of this kind of anarchic character, the outsider, being in this world - I can see it aesthetically, too - full of honor and tradition and customs and someone who’s really anti-all of that, and trying to negotiate his way.
The idea of the samurai, too - and the tradition there.
It’s really great.
This sequel will probably include the Silver Samurai.
In the comic book he gets his ass kicked by a couple of samurai - not even mutants.
He’s shocked by that at first.” He added another Wolverine film would be a follow-up rather than continuing on from X-Men: The Last Stand.
The inclusion of Deadpool and Gambit also leads to the possibilities of their own spin-offs.
Before Wolverine s release, Lauren Shuler Donner approached Simon Beaufoy to write the script, but he did not feel confident enough to commit.
On May 5, just two days after its initial weekend run, the sequel was officially confirmed.
A Deadpool spin-off has also been confirmed with Ryan Reynolds attached to reprise the role of Wade Wilson.
