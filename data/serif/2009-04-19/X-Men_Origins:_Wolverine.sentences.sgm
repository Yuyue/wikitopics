X-Men Origins: Wolverine is an upcoming superhero film based on the fictional Marvel Comics character Wolverine that will be released in most countries by May 1, 2009.
The film is directed by Gavin Hood and stars Hugh Jackman as the title character.
It is a prequel to the X-Men film trilogy, focusing on the mutant Wolverine and his time with Team X, before Wolverine's skeleton was bonded with the indestructible metal adamantium.
The film was mostly shot in Australia and New Zealand.
Premise
Set roughly twenty years before X-Men, the film will focus on Wolverine's violent past, and his early encounters with William Stryker (Danny Huston).
The Weapon X program and his interactions with other mutants will be explored, including his relationship with his half-brother Sabretooth (Liev Schreiber).
Cast
Hugh Jackman as Logan / Wolverine: The mutant and future X-Men member.
Jackman, who played Wolverine in the previous films, has also become producer of the film via his company Seed Productions, and earned $20 million for the film.
Jackman underwent a high intensity weight training regimen to bulk up for his role.
He changed the program to shock the body into change and also performed cardiovascular workouts.
He woke up each morning at 4 am to eat one of the small number of protein-based meals he was allowed each day.
He wanted to portray Wolverine exactly as he did in the character's cage match entrance in X-Men, stating his inspiration was Robert De Niro in Cape Fear.
He noted Wolverine had mellowed during the previous film and looked forward to revisiting a darker time in the character's life.
Jackman worked out in a Queenstown gym where he would arrive daily at 6 am.
He stayed in character and made noises while exercising.
Jackman noted no digital touches were applied to his physique in a shot of him rising from the tank within which Wolverine has his bones coated in adamantium.
Troye Sivan as James Howlett: Casting directors cast Sivan as the young Wolverine after seeing him sing at the Channel Seven Perth Telethon, and he was accepted after sending in an audition tape.
Kodi Smit-McPhee was originally cast in the role, when filming was originally beginning in December 2007, but he opted out to film The Road.
Liev Schreiber as Victor Creed / Sabretooth: Logan's half-brother and fellow soldier.
Jackman and Hood compared Wolverine and Sabretooth's relationship to the Borg-McEnroe rivalry in the world of tennis: Sabretooth hates him because he loved and needed his half-brother, inspired by Dog Logan, Wolverine's sibling in Origin, but is too proud to admit he needs him back.
Tyler Mane, who played him in X-Men, had hoped to reprise the role.
Jackman worked with Schreiber before, and described him as having a competitive streak necessary to portray Sabretooth.
They "egged" each other on set to perform more and more stunts.
Schreiber put on   of muscle for the part, and described Sabretooth as the most monstrous role he ever played.
As a child, he loved the Wolverine comics because of their unique "urban sensibility".
Schreiber had studied to be a fight choreographer and wanted to be a dancer like Jackman, so he enjoyed working out their fight scenes.
Danny Huston as William Stryker: Schreiber was originally in negotiations for the part, while Brian Cox, who played the character in X2, wanted to reprise the role.
He believed computer-generated imagery, similar to the program applied to Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen in the opening flashback of X-Men: The Last Stand, would allow him to appear as the younger Stryker.
Huston liked the complex Stryker, who "both loves and hates mutants because his son was a mutant and [drove] his wife [to suicide].
So he understands what they're going through, but despises their [destructive] force".
He compared the character to a racehorse breeder, who rears his mutant experiments like children but abandons them when something goes wrong.
Lynn Collins as Kayla Silver Fox: Wolverine's love interest and later captive of Stryker.
Michelle Monaghan turned down the role because of scheduling conflicts, despite her enthusiasm to work with Jackman.
Taylor Kitsch as Remy LeBeau / Gambit: A Cajun thief who has the ability to charge any object he touches with potential energy, forcing it to explode.
The size of the object determines the magnitude of the resulting explosion.
Daniel Henney as David North / Agent Zero: A member of the Weapon X program and an expert tracker with lethal marksman skills.
will.i.am as John Wraith: A teleporting mutant.
It is Will.i.am's major film debut.
Although he initially did not get on with the casting director, he got the role because he wanted to play a mutant with the same power as Nightcrawler.
He enrolled in boot camp to get into shape for the part.
When filming a fight, he scarred his knuckles after accidentally punching and breaking the camera.
Ryan Reynolds as Wade Wilson / Deadpool: A wisecracking mercenary who can heal like Wolverine.
Reynolds had been interested in playing the character in his own film since 2003.
Originally, Reynolds was only going to cameo as Wilson but the role grew after he was cast.
Scott Adkins as Weapon XI: Weapon XI has powers "pooled" from many other mutants killed and/or kidnapped in the film, including Wolverine's healing factor and Cyclops' optic blasts..
He's the final antagonist of the film, having been genetically altered to be the ultimate mutant killer.
Kevin Durand as Frederick J. Dukes: A mutant with an indestructible layer of skin.
In the film's early sequences, he is skinny, but years later, he has gained an enormous amount of weight.
Dominic Monaghan as  Chris Bradley / Bolt: A mutant who can manipulate electricity.
Tahyna Tozzi  as Emma Frost: A mutant with the powers of telepathy and turning her skin into diamond.
X2 writer Dan Harris said that Sigourney Weaver would have played Emma Frost in X-Men: The Last Stand if Bryan Singer had stayed on to direct.
The film includes numerous cameo appearances of younger versions of characters from the previous films, including Cyclops (Tim Pocock), a Weapon X captive, and Jason Stryker, William's lobotomized telepathic son whom he keeps on ice.
New characters include Banshee, who is a Weapon X captive.
There was a cameo for a young Storm, which can be seen in the trailer, but it was cut out.
Asher Keddie is in the film, but did not state who she played.
Poker player Daniel Negreanu has a cameo.
Phil Hellmuth wanted to join him but was unable because he committed to an event in Toronto.
X-Men co-creator Stan Lee said he would cameo, but he was not in Australia during filming, so this will have to be a pick-up conducted during January 2009.
Production
Development
David Benioff, a comic book fan, pursued the project for almost three years before he was hired to write the script in October 2004.
In preparing to write the script, he reread Barry Windsor-Smith's "Weapon X" story (1991), as well as Chris Claremont and Frank Miller's 1982 limited series on the character (his favorite storyline).
Jackman collaborated on the script, which he wanted to be more of a character piece compared with the previous X-Men films.
Benioff aimed for a "darker and a bit more brutal" story, writing it with an R rating in mind, although he acknowledged the film's final tone would rest with the producers and director.
Jackman did not see the need to make the film R.
Deadpool had been developed for his own film by Reynolds and David S. Goyer at New Line Cinema in 2003, but the project fell apart as they focused on Blade: Trinity and an aborted spin-off.
Benioff wrote the character into the script in a manner Jackman described as fun, but would also deviate from some of his traits.
Similarly, Gambit was a character who the filmmakers had tried to put in the previous X-Men films.
Jackman liked Gambit because he is a "loose cannon" like Wolverine, stating their relationship echoes that of Wolverine and Pyro in the original trilogy.
David Ayer contributed to the script.
Benioff finished his draft in October 2006, and Jackman stated there would be a year before shooting, as he was scheduled to start filming Australia (2008) during 2007.
Before the 2007â€“2008 Writers Guild of America strike began, James Vanderbilt and Scott Silver were hired for a last-minute rewrite.
Gavin Hood was announced as director of the project in July 2007 for a 2008 release.
Previously, X-Men and X2 director Bryan Singer and X-Men: The Last Stand director Brett Ratner were interested in returning to the franchise, while Alexandre Aja and Len Wiseman also wanted the job.
Zack Snyder, who was approached for The Last Stand, turned down this film because he was directing Watchmen.
Jackman saw parallels between Logan and the main character in Tsotsi.
Hood explained that while he was not a comic book fan, he "realized that the character of Wolverine, I think his great appeal lies in the fact that he's someone who in some ways, is filled with a great deal of self-loathing by his own nature and he's constantly at war with his own nature".
The director described the film's themes as focusing on Wolverine's inner struggle between his animalistic savagery and noble human qualities.
Hood enjoyed the previous films, but set out to give the spin-off a different feel.
In October, Fox announced a May 1, 2009 release date and the X-Men Origins prefix.
Filming
Preliminary shooting took place at Fox Studios Australia (in Sydney) during late 2007.
Principal photography began on January 18, 2008 in New Zealand.
Locations included Dunedin.
Controversy arose as the Queenstown Lakes District Council disputed the Department of Labour's decision to allow Fox to store explosives in the local ice skating rink.
Fox moved some of the explosives to another area.
The explosives were used for a shot of the exploding Hudson Farm, a scene which required four cameras.
Jackman and Palermo's Woz Productions reached an agreement with the council to allow recycling specialists on set to advise the production on being environmentally friendly.
Filming continued at Fox (where most of the shooting was done) and New Orleans, Louisiana.
Cockatoo Island was used for Stryker's facility; the enormous buildings there saved money on digitally expanding a set.
Production of the film was predicted to generate $60 million in Sydney's economy.
Principal photography ended by May 23.
The second unit continued filming in New Zealand until March 23, and were scheduled to continue filming for two weeks following the first unit's wrap.
This included a flashback to Logan during the Normandy Landings, which was shot at Blacksmiths, New South Wales.
Hood and Fox disputed on the film's direction.
The studio had two replacements lined up before Richard Donner, husband of producer Lauren Shuler Donner, flew to Australia to ease on-set tensions.
Hood remarked, "Out of healthy and sometimes very rigorous debate, things get better.
[...] I hope the film's better because of the debates.
If nobody were talking about us, we'd be in trouble!
" Hood added he and Thomas Rothman were both "forceful" personalities in creative meetings but they had never had a "stand-up" argument.Two weeks of pick-ups began on January 12, 2009, in Vancouver.
These included finishing scenes with Ryan Reynolds, who had been working on two other films during principal photography.
Shots were filmed at the University of British Columbia.
Release
Leaked workprint
On March 31, 2009, a full length DVD-quality workprint of the film without a timecode or watermark, with some unfinished effects shots, was leaked online.
The print contained a reference to Rising Sun Pictures, an Australian visual effects company working on the film.
Within a day, the film had been downloaded 75,000 times, a sum comparable to when The Dark Knight s DVD was leaked.
Since the workprint had forensic marks, the studio may be able to determine the source of the leak but it has not disclosed any findings.
The FBI and the MPAA are investigating the illegal posting.
Executive producer Thomas Rothman noted the leaked version lacked the ten minutes added during pick-ups in January 2009, while Rising Sun Pictures denied that they ever had a full copy of the film.
Roger Friedman, a columnist for Fox News, reviewed the leaked workprint, adding, "It took really less than seconds to start playing it all right onto my computer," and his employment was terminated by News Corporation.
Theatrical run
X-Men Origins: Wolverine is due for release on April 29, 2009 in the UK, April 30, 2009 in Australia, and May 1, 2009 in the United States and Canada.
Video game
Raven Software is developing a video game based on the film with the same name, which Activision Blizzard will publish.
Marc Guggenheim wrote the script.
Sequel
Hood speculated that there could be a sequel, which may be set in Japan.
Such a location was the subject of Claremont and Miller's series, which was not in the first film as Jackman felt â€œwhat we need to do is establish who [Logan] is and find out how he became Wolverine".
Jackman stated the Claremont-Miller series is his favorite Wolverine story.
He added another Wolverine film would be a follow-up rather than continuing on from X-Men: The Last Stand.
The inclusion of Deadpool and Gambit also leads to the possibilities of their own spin-offs.
Before Wolverine s release, Lauren Shuler Donner approached Simon Beaufoy to write the script, but he did not feel confident enough to commit.
