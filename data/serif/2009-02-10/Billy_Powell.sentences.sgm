William Norris "Billy" Powell (June 3, 1952 January 28, 2009) was an American musician.
He was the longtime keyboardist of Southern rock band Lynyrd Skynyrd.
Biography
Born in Corpus Christi, Texas, Powell grew up in a military family (his father was in the U.S. Navy) and spent several years of his childhood living in Italy where his father was stationed.
After his father died of cancer in 1960, he moved with his family back to the United States and settled in Jacksonville, Florida.
His mother enrolled him at the Sanford Naval Academy in Sanford, Florida.
While at Sanford, Billy's interest in music began to grow and he began taking piano lessons from a local teacher named Madeleine Brown.
She swore he did not need her, claiming that Billy was a natural and picked things up well on his own.
Musical career
Billy returned to Jacksonville where he enrolled at Bishop Kenny High School.
It was here that he met Leon Wilkeson, future bassist for Lynyrd Skynyrd.
The two soon became close friends.
When he graduated in 1970, he enrolled briefly in a community college, majoring in Music Theory.
Around this time he found work as a roadie for Lynyrd Skynyrd.
Powell remained a roadie for Skynyrd until 1972, when the band was hired to play the Bolles School prom.
After setting up the band's equipment, Billy sat down at a piano in the corner of the room and began to play his own version of 'Free Bird'.
Lead singer Ronnie Van Zant was impressed, and invited Powell to join Lynyrd Skynyrd officially as their new keyboard player.
In 1973, Lynyrd Skynyrd was signed to MCA Records and received national exposure with the release of their first album, (pronounced 'lĕh-'nérd 'skin-'nérd).
The band's popularity soared in 1974 with their follow-up album, Second Helping, which featured their highest-charting single, "Sweet Home Alabama".
The band enjoyed great popularity over the next three years, culminating in the 1977 release of Street Survivors, which many considered to be their strongest effort to date.
However, three days after the release of Street Survivors, Skynyrd's chartered plane crashed into a forest near McComb, Mississippi.
The crash took the lives of singer Ronnie Van Zant, guitarist Steve Gaines, his sister and backing vocalist Cassie Gaines, assistant road manager Dean Kilpatrick, and both pilots.
The remainder of the band suffered injuries ranging from mild to severe.
Powell suffered severe facial lacerations, almost completely losing his nose but was otherwise relatively uninjured.
He was the first to be released from the hospital, and the only member able to attend the funerals of his fallen bandmates.
During the time between the plane crash and the Lynyrd Skynyrd reunion in 1987, Powell briefly joined a Christian rock band named Vision.
His keyboard playing was often spotlighted in Vision concerts.
Powell also spoke during the concerts about his newly found faith in Jesus Christ.
Powell rejoined Lynyrd Skynyrd in 1987 for a tribute tour, and remained with the band until his death.
Guitarist Gary Rossington is the only member from the classic lineup who continues to record and perform with the reunited band today.
Death
On January 28, 2009, the keyboardist died at the age of 56 at his home in Orange Park, Florida.
Powell called 911 at 12:55 a.m., complaining of shortness of breath.
He missed his appointment with the doctor on the day before his death; the appointment was for a checkup on his heart.
The EMS responders found Powell unconscious and unresponsive, with the telephone still in his hand.
Rescue crews performed CPR, but he was pronounced dead at 1:52 am.
A heart attack was the suspected cause of death, but an autopsy was not performed.
