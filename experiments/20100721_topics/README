Algorithm
=========
All the non-namespace-0 pages are filtered out.

The page view counts are accumulated in a map that has page titles as keys and page views as values.
When each pagecounts file is processed, the page views in the file are added to the map appropriately, and the page views in the oldest file within the period are subtracted from the map appropriately.
