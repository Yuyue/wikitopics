The 2010 FIFA World Cup will be the 19th FIFA World Cup, the premier international football tournament.
It is scheduled to take place between 11 June and 11 July 2010 in South Africa.
The 2010 FIFA World Cup will be the culmination of a qualification process that began in August 2007 and involved 204 of the 208 FIFA national teams.
As such, it matches the 2008 Summer Olympics as the sports event with the most competing nations.
This will be the first time that the tournament has been hosted by an African nation, after South Africa beat Morocco and Egypt in an all-African bidding process.
Italy are the defending champions, having secured qualification for the final tournament on 10 October 2009.
The draw for the finals will take place on 4 December 2009 in Cape Town.
Host selection
Africa was chosen as the host for the 2010 World Cup as part of a new policy to rotate the event between football confederations (which was later abandoned in October 2007).
Five African nations placed bids to host the 2010 World Cup:
/   (co-hosting)
Following the decision of the FIFA Executive Committee not to allow co-hosted tournaments, Tunisia withdrew from the bidding process.
The committee also decided not to consider Libya's solo bid as it no longer met all the stipulations laid down in the official List of Requirements.
After one round of voting, the winning bid was announced by FIFA president Sepp Blatter at a media conference on 15 May 2004 in Zürich.
South Africa was awarded the rights to host the tournament, defeating Morocco and Egypt.
withdrew on 8 May 2004 after joint bidding was not allowed
bid was rejected: bid did not meet the list of requirements and joint bidding was not allowed
Qualification
As the host nation, South Africa qualifies automatically for the tournament.
However, South Africa was the first host since 1934 to participate in World Cup qualifiers.
This is because the CAF qualifiers also serve as the qualifying tournament for the 2010 African Cup of Nations, for which South Africa had to qualify separately (South Africa were eliminated after the second of three rounds of qualifying).
Like the previous tournament, the defending champions Italy do not qualify automatically.
The preliminary draw for the 2010 World Cup was held in Durban, South Africa, on 25 November 2007.
The Final draw for the 2010 FIFA World Cup will be staged in Cape Town, South Africa, on 4 December 2009 at the Cape Town International Convention Centre.
List of qualified teams
The following 19 teams have qualified as of 10 October 2009.
1.
Standings are current as of 2 September 2009.
2.
Competed as West Germany from 1954 to 1990.
3.

Mascot
The official mascot for the 2010 FIFA World Cup is Zakumi, a leopard with green hair.
His name comes from "ZA", the international abbreviation for South Africa, and "kumi", a word that means "ten" in various African languages.
The mascot's colours reflect those of the host nation's playing strip – yellow and green.
Venues
In 2005, the organisers released a provisional list of thirteen venues to be used for the World Cup: Bloemfontein, Cape Town, Durban, Johannesburg (two venues), Kimberley, Nelspruit, Orkney, Pietersburg (also known as Polokwane), Port Elizabeth, Pretoria (two venues), and Rustenburg.
This was narrowed down to ten venues which were officially announced by FIFA on 17 March 2006:
Preparations
Five new stadiums are to be built for the tournament (three new match venues and two new practice grounds), and five of the existing venues are to be upgraded.
Construction costs are expected to be R8.4bn.
In addition to the stadiums being built and upgraded, South Africa is also planning to improve its current public transport infrastructure within the various cities, with projects such as the Gautrain and the new Bus Rapid Transit system (BRT) titled Rea Vaya.
Danny Jordaan, the president of the 2010 World Cup organising committee has said that he expects all stadiums for the tournament to be completed by October 2009.
The country is also going to implement special measures to ensure the safety and security of local and international tourists attending the matches in accordance with standard FIFA requirements.
Construction strike
70,000 construction workers who were supposed to be working on the new stadiums walked off their jobs on 8 July 2009.
The majority of the workers receive R2500 per month (about £192, €224 or $313), but the unions allege that some workers are grossly underpaid – some receiving as little as R40 (£3.11) a week.
A spokesperson for the National Union of Mineworkers said to the SABC that the "no work no pay" strike will go on until FIFA assesses penalties on the organisers.
Other unions threatened to strike into 2011.
The World Cup organising committee downplayed the strike and expressed confidence that the stadiums will be ready.
Relocation rumours
During 2006 to 2007, rumours circulated in various news sources that the 2010 World Cup could be moved to another country.
Some people, including Franz Beckenbauer, Horst R. Schmidt and, reportedly, some FIFA executives, expressed concern over the planning, organisation, and pace of South Africa’s preparations.
However, FIFA officials repeatedly expressed their confidence in South Africa as host, and stated that the event will not be moved, with FIFA president Sepp Blatter re-iterating that "Plan A... Plan B... Plan C is that the 2010 World Cup will be staged in South Africa".
Blatter stated that there is a contingency plan to hold the World Cup elsewhere but only in the event of a natural catastrophe, and that the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany also had a similar contingency plan.
Despite reassurances by FIFA that the event would only be moved in the case of natural catastrophe, rumours continued to circulate about possible relocation of the event.
These rumours were criticised by South Africa's Deputy Finance Minister Jabu Moleketi, saying that some have targeted the event to reflect their persistent negativity towards South Africa and Africa.
Controversies
As with many 'hallmark events' throughout the world, the 2010 FIFA World Cup has been connected to evictions in South Africa which many claim are meant to 'beautify the city', impress visiting tourists, and hide shackdwellers.
On 14 May 2009, Durban-based shack-dwellers took the KwaZulu-Natal government to court over their controversial Elimination and Prevention of Re-Emergence of Slums Act, meant to eliminate slums in South Africa and put homeless shackdwellers in transit camps in time for the 2010 World Cup.
They have gained a lot of publicity for their efforts even in the international media.
The most prominent controversy surrounding preparations for the World Cup is the N2 Gateway housing project in Cape Town, which plans to remove over 20,000 residents from Joe Slovo Informal Settlement along the busy N2 Freeway and build rental flats and bond houses in its place in time for the 2010 World Cup.
The residents would be moved to the poverty stricken Delft township on the outskirts of the city and out of sight from the N2 Freeway.
In July 2009, South Africa was hit with rolling protests by poor communities who demanded access to basic services, jobs, adequate housing and the democratisation of service delivery.
These protests have been linked to the World Cup as protesters complain that public funds are being diverted away from social issues to build stadiums and upgrade airports.

Tie-breaking criteria
In world football, there are various methods used to separate teams with equal points in a league.
For the World Cup tournament, FIFA uses the following system.
The ranking in each group is determined as follows:
greatest number of points obtained in all group matches;
goal difference in all group matches;
greatest number of goals scored in all group matches.
If two or more teams are equal on the basis of the above three criteria, their rankings will be determined as follows:
greatest number of points obtained in the group matches between the teams concerned;
goal difference resulting from the group matches between the teams concerned;
greater number of goals scored in all group matches between the teams concerned;
drawing of lots by the FIFA Organising Committee.
