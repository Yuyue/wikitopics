"Pinewood Derby" is the sixth episode of the thirteenth season of the animated television series South Park.

The episode is rated TV-MA L.
Plot
Randy Marsh is determined to make sure that Stan wins the annual state pinewood derby.
He slips a device into the rear end of the car in order to give it an advantage.
Stan learns from a news report, much to his disgust, that the device is a superconducting magnet, stolen from the Large Hadron Collider by Randy disguised as Princess Leia Organa.
During the finals, Stan lies at the check-in table (with Randy’s coaching) and says that he used only the parts in the approved pinewood derby kit.
He wins first place, setting a new speed record; at the same time, the car shoots off the track and into space, reaching warp speed.
Not long afterward, two NSA agents visit the Marshes and tell them that an alien species found the car and is on the way to Earth to make contact.
A spaceship lands in South Park, but its pilot is a bank robber named Baby Fark McGee-zax, who demands that Stan and Randy build him a new warp drive while holding the entire planet at gunpoint.
Everyone believes that they can do it using only the approved kit.
Stan tries to persuade Randy to tell the truth about the stolen magnet, but Randy refuses because he does not want to look stupid in front of the whole town.
As they keep working, an Intergalactic Police ship approaches Earth; McGee-zax cloaks his ship and drags Stan out of sight, leaving the townspeople to divert the officers’ questions until they leave.
Even though the officers say that McGee-zax stole a large sum of "space cash" from the Universal Bank, no one admits to seeing him.
After Stan and Randy finish the car, Stan stabs McGee-zax to death at Randy’s urging.
The ship is promptly decloaked and found to contain the stolen space cash.
Instead of calling the Intergalactic Police, though, Randy persuades everyone to keep quiet and divide up the money, buying the world leaders’ silence by giving them shares as well.
Four days later, as Randy is trying to keep the peace among them, the two officers land in South Park again.
They now know that McGee-zax landed here and Randy tells them of his death, but everyone denies finding any space cash — even though the country of Mexico has suddenly built many new hospitals and waterparks.
Randy berates the Mexican government for jeopardizing the cover-up with this spending spree after the officers have left.
While Stan glumly stares at his first-place trophy and the newspaper articles he has collected, almost every one of which shows Randy excited and himself uneasy, Randy is still trying to keep other countries from doing as Mexico did.
Learning that Finland is about to tell the Intergalactic Police the truth, he persuades the rest of the world to wipe it out in an immediate nuclear missile attack.
The Intergalactic Police pay a third visit to ask about the strike, prompting fake disbelief from the world that in turn rouses the officers’ suspicions.
By this time, Stan has had enough of the deception, tells the truth about cheating in the pinewood derby, and returns his trophy; however, no one else on the planet is willing to talk about anything else that has happened.
McGee-zax now emerges from the officers’ ship alive and well, having faked his death earlier.
He reveals that he is really Kevorn Zaxor, ambassador to new world testing, and that the entire chain of events was a test to see if Earth was worthy of joining the intergalactic community.
As punishment for failing that test so badly, Earth and the Moon are permanently enclosed in a gigantic, cubical force field and isolated from the rest of the Universe — to which Randy says, "Well, that sucks".
Production
"Pinewood Derby" was written and directed by series co-founder Trey Parker.
It first aired on April 15, 2009 in the United States on Comedy Central and aired in the United Kingdom on April 17, 2009.
The theme of the episode was a warning about the dangers of greed, lying and cheating.
Cultural references
The pinewood derby, which is a large part of the episode's plot and inspired the title, is a racing event with the Cub Scouts and Boy Scouts of America.
Baby Fark McGee-zax talks in a similar way to Edward G. Robinson, a movie star known for such 1930s and 1940s gangster films as Little Caesar and Key Largo, and his name is derived from Baby Face Nelson.
While stealing the superconducting magnet, Randy dresses like Princess Leia Organa from the Star Wars films.
The "red ones go faster" is a special rule in Warhammer 40,000.
The visit from an alien immediately after Earth achieves warp speed for the first time is from Star Trek: First Contact.
A reporter wonders whether the first contact with alien life forms will be like the films Star Trek: First Contact or the drama film Contact starring Jodie Foster.
The depiction of the space cops is based on the lounge singers from the planet Carillon on the original 1978 Battlestar Galactica.
There is also a reference to Goodfellas when Randy gets mad at the other countries for spending the money lavishly after they got it because he doesn't want things to seem too obvious to the cops.
Among the world leaders who communicate with Randy in the episode are Mexican President Felipe Calderón (with whom Randy gets mad because of spending the space money), British Prime Minister Gordon Brown (with a stereotypically English accent rather than his distinctly Scottish one), French President Nicolas Sarkozy, Prime Minister of Italy Silvio Berlusconi, Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva,, President of the People's Republic of China Hu Jintao, Prime Minister of Kenya Raila Odinga and Prime Minister of Russia Vladimir Putin.
The leader of Australia appears to be former prime minister John Howard, who has not been in office since 2007, the actual Australian Prime Minister at the time of the episode is Kevin Rudd.
The Finnish diplomat talking with Randy is likely to be Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen.
The scene where Emmit Hollus watched his father shoot himself and then screamed "He's ok, he's ok, he's ok...".
over and over is a spin off Mrs. Perry from the suicide scene in Dead Poet's Society.
When the space cops are about to leave a second time, one of them absentmindedly turns around and says "just one more thing".
This is the signature remark of homicide detective Columbo, from the TV series with the same name.
Reception
The episode received mixed reviews.
Josh Modell of The A.V.
Club said the episode was boring and unfunny, and was particularly disappointing following the episode "Fishsticks" the previous week.
Modell said, "South Park episodes don’t get much lazier or uninspired than this one.
It was like half an idea stretched out forever and ever, and with very little payoff".
Carlos Delgado said the episode plot was too silly and lacked laughs: "All in all, I was left feeling a little cheated.
"Pinewood Derby" wasn’t funny, it was just weird".
Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly said the episode was told with "the warp-speed storytelling style that is making this season one of South Park's best".
Travis Fickett of IGN said he was happy to see an episode centered around Randy Marsh, who he said is an excellent character; Fickett said of "Pinewood Derby", "This isn't a great episode but it's fast-paced lunacy in the South Park tradition and most of the genre tropes it riffs on are dead on".
