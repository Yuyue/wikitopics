Sanctioning and rules controversy
On February 12, 2009, reports surfaced that province regulators ("Régie des alcools, des courses et des jeux", or RACJ) requested a set of rule changes that differ from the Unified Rules of MMA has put the event at risk from taking place.
The proposed rule changes banned elbow and knee strikes, mandated a smaller cage, and would stop a fight when a fighter gets knocked down.
Before, the RACJ has followed the Unified Rules, but as laws differ by city, state, or province, a commission can insist on the usage of its own rules.
On February 18, 2009, it was announced that UFC officials were able to convince the RACJ to reverse its stand and use the Unified Rules.
As a concession, the UFC agreed to the banning of foot stomps for this event.
Therefore, UFC 97 will remain in Montreal on April 18, 2009, as originally planned.
