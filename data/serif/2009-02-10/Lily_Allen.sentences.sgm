Childhood and discovery
Allen was born in Hammersmith, west London, daughter of Welsh-born comedian Keith Allen and English film producer Alison Owen.
She and her family eventually settled in the North London borough of Islington.
She has an older sister, Sarah; a younger brother, Alfie Owen-Allen (who was the subject of her song Alfie); and a younger sister Rebecca.
She also has a number of half-siblings.
Lily Allen lived for a while with comedian Harry Enfield while her mother dated him.
She is the god-daughter of Wild Colonials vocalist Angela McCluskey.
The late Clash guitarist Joe Strummer is also referred to as a godparent.
While not literally true, Strummer was close to and mentored Allen.
In 1988, at the age of 3, Allen appeared on The Comic Strip Presents... episode The Yob, which her father had co-written.
When Allen was four years old, her father left the family.
Allen claims to have grown up with her mother in a working class environment, living in a council house environment for most of her childhood.
This seems at odds with the fact that she attended some of the UK's costliest public schools; Allen attended 13 schools in all, including Prince Charles's junior alma mater, Hill House School, Millfield and Bedales School, and was expelled from several of them for drinking, and smoking.
Allen told Loveline that, when she was 11, she was singing an Oasis tune in the school playground when a teacher overheard her and told her she had talent and suggested she do something with it.
She took singing lessons with the teacher.
She sang at a school play and claimed that the audience was brought to tears at the sight of a troubled young girl doing something good.
At that point Allen said she knew that music was something she needed to do either as a lifelong vocation or to get it out of her system.
Allen played piano to grade 5 standard and achieved grade 8 in singing.
She also played violin, guitar and trumpet as well as being a member of a chamber choir.
Her first solo was In the Bleak Midwinter.
According to The Sunday Times the only school that seemed to have a positive impact on her was Cavendish an all-girl Catholic school located in Camden Town.
At Cavendish, Allen played a boy in a production of The Railway Children and sang Baby Mine in Dumbo.
Allen made an appearance as a lady-in-waiting in the 1998 film Elizabeth, co-produced by her mother.
She dropped out of school at age fifteen, not wanting to "spend a third of her life preparing to work for the next third of her life, to set herself up with a pension for the next third of her life".
After her family went to Ibiza on holiday, Allen told her mother that she was staying with friends but remained in Sant Antoni de Portmany instead.
She earned money by working at a Plastic Fantastic record store and dealing in ecstasy.
At the age of 17, Allen became a member of the Groucho Club and in her free time she listened to artists such as The Specials, T.Rex and Happy Mondays.
Music career
Record label interest
Allen met her first manager, George Lamb, in Ibiza when he saved her from several assailants and sent her home.
Allen was rejected by several labels, which she attributed to her drinking and being the daughter of Keith Allen.
Lily eventually used her father's connections to get signed to London Records a part of the Warner Music in 2002.
When the executive who had signed her left, the label lost interest and she left without releasing the folk songs many of which were written by her father.
Allen studied horticulture with the intention of becoming a florist, but changed her mind and returned to music.
She began writing songs, and her manager introduced her to production duo Future Cut in 2004.
They worked in a small studio in the basement of an office building.
In 2005, Allen was signed to Regal Records; they gave her £25,000 to produce an album, though they were unable to provide much support for it due to their preoccupation with other releases such as Coldplay's X&Y and Gorillaz's Demon Days.
Popularity on MySpace
Allen created an account on MySpace and began posting demos in November 2005.
The demos attracted thousands of listeners, and 500 limited edition 7" vinyl singles of LDN were rush-released, reselling for as much as £40.
Allen also produced two mixtapes — My First Mixtape and My Second Mixtape — to promote her work: they included tracks by Creedence Clearwater Revival, Dizzee Rascal, and Ludacris.
As she accumulated tens of thousands of MySpace friends, The Observer Music Monthly (OMM), a magazine published in The Observer, took interest.
Few people outside of her label's A&R department knew who she was, so the label was slow in responding to publications wanting to report about her.
In March 2006, OMM included an article about Allen's success through MySpace.
She received her first major mainstream coverage, appearing in the magazine's cover story two months later.
The success of her songs convinced her label to allow her more creative control over the album and to use some of the songs that she had written instead of forcing her to work with mainstream producers.
Allen decided to work with producers Greg Kurstin and Mark Ronson, finishing the rest of the album in two weeks.
The social networking site was the primary hub for messages of support and condolence following her January 2008 miscarriage.
Allen received a 2008 NME Award nomination for the category of "Best Band Blog".
As of 9 February 2009, Allen's songs have been downloaded from her MySpace page more than 32 million times.
As of 9 February 2009, Allen had more than 448,000 MySpace.
She was the fifth most popular musical act of the 2008 according to the social networking site.
Allen used her MySpace blog regularly to discuss personal issues and the controversies surrounding her.
By February 2009 she had stopped the practice because "It's boring when people just pick stuff up and write about it.
People get hurt, people get upset".
Alright, Still
Allen's debut album, Alright, Still, was released as a limited-edition 12" vinyl in the UK on 3 July 2006; the full CD release followed in the UK and the rest of Europe on 17 July 2006.
The album features between 11 and 14 tracks (depending on the edition), most of which were previewed on her MySpace page, including the single Smile (the first song she wrote with Future Cut), LDN, Knock 'Em Out, and Alfie.
Friday Night, co-written with Jonny Bull, was also included, alongside Littlest Things produced by Mark Ronson, help earn Ronson a "Producer of the Year - Non Classical" 2008 Grammy Award.
In September 2006, Smile was made available on the United States version of Apple Inc.'s iTunes Store.
By December 2006, her music video for Smile had been played on various music channels as well as the song getting a little airplay.
Entertainment Weekly named Alright, Still as one of the top 10 albums of 2006 despite the fact that it had not yet been released in the U.S. Allen also did several promotional ads for MTV as their Discover and Download artist of the month for January 2007.
On the week ending on 28 January 2007, British artists made chart history taking all top 10 places in the Official UK Albums chart for the first time since the chart was established in 1956, according to British record labels trade association the BPI, the album Alright, Still was number nine that week.
The album was released in the United States on 30 January 2007, landing at 20 on the Billboard Album Charts.
Allen won a 2008 BMI songwriting award for Smile.
Smile was the first single.
The U.S. version contains three additional tracks: Nan, You're A Window Shopper, Blank Expression (on the iTunes version) and a new remix of Smile by Mark Ronson.
On 5 March 2007, Alfie was released.
It reached 15 in the UK Singles-Chart.
She sang on the Mark Ronson-produced Kaiser Chiefs' song Oh My God.
By January 2009 the album had sold 960,000 copies in the United Kingdom and 520,000 copies in the United States.
Allen said that she cringes when she listens to this album because it reminds her that she was a "sort of over-excitable teenager who desperately wanted attention".
when she wrote it
It's Not Me, It's You
In April 2008, Allen said she was heading in a "new direction".
She posted two new song demos on her MySpace page and planned to release a mixtape to give her fans an idea of what the new direction was.
Allen said the new direction was undertaken because:  "I did a retro thing last time,  and since I did that, a lot of other people did it too.
I wanted to separate myself from the group and move forward".
For this  reason, Allen choose not not to work with Mark Ronson on It's Not Me, It's You.
Allen posted on her MySpace page a partial clip of a song that was eventually entitled Fuck You which is on the album.
The song was originally written about The British National Party but ended up being about George W. Bush
As of 19 August there has been between 250,000 and one million plays for each song from the album that she has made available to listen to on her MySpace page.
The album was released on 9 February 2009 in the United Kingdom and the following day in the United States.
The Fear, the first single from album was released digitally on 9 December 2008 and released on CD on 26 January 2009.
It entered the chart at number 136 on limited edition releases before climbing straight to number 1 on 1 February upon its official release.
The  The video for the single was released 4 December.
Three weeks before its release the single was in top 20 on Nielsen Music Control's U.K. Radio Airplay.
In the United States on 12 January, the single was "worked" to Triple A Radio formats then Top 40.
The song is based on Allen’s fear that the world will become a sterile place where everything is sponsored.
The single is described as an electropop track that discusses celebrity culture.
At the urging of her record company, Allen tried unsuccessfully to create the album with several writers and producers.
Allen eventually returned to Greg Kurstin who had written three songs for Alright, Still.
The album was produced by Kurstin at Eagle Rock Studios in Los Angeles.
Before returning to Kus, Allen co-wrote the songs for the album with Kurstin who played piano on it.
This is a change from her earlier work in which she wrote lyrics for finished tracks.
.
Allen released a statement saying  "We decided to try and make bigger sounding, more ethereal songs, real songs...
I wanted to work with one person from start to finish to make it one body of work.
I wanted it to feel like it had some sort of integrity.
I think I've grown up a bit as a person and I hope it reflects that".
Other songs on the album include He Wasn't There, a letter to her father one of three songs about immediate family members.
Him is about God and includes her favourite line on the record: "Do you think he's ever been suicidal?/ His favourite band is Creedence Clearwater Revival".
Not Fair, a humorous song about a lazy lover, includes the lyrics "feeling pretty damn hard done by, I spent ages giving head".
Allen has played the song to the person in question and he did not realise the song was about him.
22 was written about a specific person but ended up as a more general song about females who rely on their looks and find at the age of 30, according to Allen, that "it hits them that they're not doing anything with their lives and it's too late".
Who'd Have Known is a pastiche of the Take That song Shine.
Take That allowed Allen to use the song on the album but did turned down an offer to sing with and do a video with Allen.. Chinese references take-away food.
On 23 October, Allen released Everyone's At It the first track from the album for download on her MySpace page.
The song appears to be a commentary on the drug culture and is expected to cause controversy.
It includes the lyrics "I'm not trying to say that I'm smelling of roses but when will we tire of putting shit up our noses...
It's meant to be fun and this just doesn't feel right...
So you've got a prescription, and that makes it legal.
I find those excuses overwhelmingly feeble… The kids are in danger, they're all getting hurt.
From what I can see, everyone's at it"..
An online game, Escape the Fear, has been created by Matmi as part of the viral marketing campaign targeted at people unaware of Allen or the album.
Players playing the role of Allen must negotiate a series of obstacles standing in the way of Allen's dreams.
Music business issues
After the release of her first album, her record company, EMI, was taken over by Terra Firma.
Her management company, Empire Artist Management, was replaced by Twenty-First Artists although her core team remained in place.
It's Not Me, It's You was first scheduled for an early 2008 release but her miscarriage and creative issues delayed the release date to the autumn.
During autumn 2008, EMI was undergoing restructuring.
According to Allen,this led to a situation were "everyone is terrified of losing their jobs.
So no one wants to make decisions or give you their opinion in case it comes back on them.
As an artist, that really is terrifying".
Due to this negative environment, a decision with Allen's full approval was made to move the albums eventual release date in February 2009".
