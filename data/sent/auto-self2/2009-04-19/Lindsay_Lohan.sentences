The Beverly Hills police department announced on March 14, 2009 that they had issued a warrant for Lohan's arrest in connection with the May 2007 hit-and-run and DUI allagations, but the matter turned out to be a "misunderstanding" according to Lohan's attorney, and the judge dismissed the warrant.
