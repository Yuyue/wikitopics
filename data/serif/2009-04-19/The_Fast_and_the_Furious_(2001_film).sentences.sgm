Plot
Brian O'Conner (Walker) is an undercover cop infiltrating Hollywood's street racing scene.
Going by the name Brian Earl Spilner, O'Conner races elite street racer Dominic Toretto and two other racers.
Brian loses his car and the race to Toretto but gets in his good graces by saving him from the police.
Brian reports his findings to his superiors, but they soon notice he's getting close with Toretto, growing wary of Brian.
After another truck hijacking occurs, the police move in and arrest all the members of Tran's gang, but find that the players were legally purchased and that they are not the ones doing the hijackings.
Brian's superior tells him about the truckers arming themselves and that it has to be Toretto doing it, giving him a sudden deadline.
Brian casually asks Toretto that whatever he is doing, he wants in on it as well.
Toretto agrees as long as Brian wins the upcoming Race Wars.
During Race Wars, Toretto's friend Jesse races his Volkswagen Jetta against Johnny Tran's Honda S2000 for pink slips and loses.
In a state of panic, Jesse drives away from the race.
Shortly after beating Jesse in a race, Tran then confronts Dominic Toretto and accuses him of calling the feds on him and having him being disrespected in front of his father and family, which leads to Dominic punching him out 6 times and they having a scuffle on the ground (not realizing the person responsible for the SWAT invasion, Brian O'Conner, was right in front of him).
During the night, Toretto and the rest of the clan drive out.
Brian confesses to Mia that he's a cop and tells her that the truckers are now armed.
He convinces her to come with him to save her brother and his friends.
They trace his cell phone and track him down.
Toretto pulls out the Honda Civics to make one last truck jacking.
While pulling the job, Toretto notices the truck driver is armed with a shotgun.
Vince's arm is trapped in the wire as Letty and Toretto try to rescue him.
Letty's Civic soon flips over and Dominic soon skids off the road.
Brian catches up and helps Vince off the truck.
Brian phones in for a life flight helicopter, revealing to Toretto his serial number and that he is a cop.
Vince is taken to a hospital, and Toretto and Mia drive off angrily.
Brian confronts Toretto at his house.
When Jesse comes back, Johnny Tran and his cousin show up to pull off a drive-by, killing Jesse in the process.
Brian and Dominic drive out to go after them.
Dominic forces one cycle to flip over using his 1970 Dodge Charger.
Brian successfully shoots Tran, killing him.
They then find themselves at an intersection and engage in a street race to a set of train tracks exactly a quarter mile away.
As a train approaches, both cars manage to speed up and pass the tracks as the train barrels down on them.
Dominic is then sideswiped by an unexpected truck and his car flips over.
Brian then goes to check on Dominic.
Suddenly, they notice that the cops are coming.
Knowing Dominic will be arrested when they arrive, Brian gives his keys to Dominic, saying, "I owe you a ten-second car".
Brian then allows Dominic to escape.
After the credits end, there is a scene that shows Toretto driving around Baja, Mexico.

Reception
The Fast and the Furious was met with mixed reviews, and received particularly harsh criticism for what some felt was its derivative storyline, which shared many similarities with the 1991 film Point Break.
Early on, the script drew criticism from die-hard tuner enthusiasts for its technical inaccuracies and for its use of  the word "NOS" (Nitrous Oxide System, a registered trademark of Holley Performance Products) to refer generically to several forms of nitrous oxide injection: in the film, both Holley's NOS and Nitrous Express' NX systems are displayed prominently.
This gaffe was corrected in the sequel, 2 Fast 2 Furious, wherein nitrous oxide injection systems were referred to as, simply, "nitrous".
The movie spawned video games and three sequels.
The movie was filmed under the working-title "Redline" and it was not until months after wrapping that the title was officially set.
The title was later used by an unrelated film that drew its inspiration from The Fast and the Furious.
Box office
The film was an unexpected summer hit.
It grossed $40,089,015 on its opening weekend, surpassing the film's $38 million budget.
It grossed a total of $144,533,925 on the domestic market, and $62,750,000 overseas, for a total of $207,283,925.
Video game
In Japan where the movie is known as Wild Speed, a The Fast and The Furious arcade video game was released by Taito in 2006.
A trailer for the movie was included in the 2001 PlayStation 2 game Tokyo Extreme Racer Zero which is part of the influential long running Shutokou Battle series itself inspired by the Freeway Speedway 1980s movies.
Also, a game for the Wii known as Crusin' is an almost exact copy of the Fast and the Furious arcade game.
Featured cars
Various modified and upgraded cars are featured in the movie, including the following:
Sequels
The film has spawned three sequels: 2 Fast 2 Furious (2003), The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006), and Fast & Furious (2009).
