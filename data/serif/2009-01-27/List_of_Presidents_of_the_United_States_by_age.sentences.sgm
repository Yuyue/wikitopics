This is a list of United States Presidents by age.
This table can be sorted to display United States Presidents by name, order of office, date of birth, age at inauguration, length of retirement, or lifespan.
Age at inauguration is determined by the day a president assumed office, not the day of the election.
Two measures of longevity are given; this is to allow for the differing number of leap days occurring within the life of each President.
The first figure is the number of days between date of birth and date of death, allowing for leap days; in parenthesis the same period given in years
and days, with the years being the number of whole years the President lived, and the days being the remaining number of days after his last birthday.
Overview
The median age of accession is 54yr 6mo 18dy, which falls between George W. Bush (22nd youngest) and Herbert Hoover (23rd).
The youngest president elected to office was John F. Kennedy.
The youngest to assume office by any means was Theodore Roosevelt, who was elevated to the Oval Office following William McKinley's assassination.
The oldest president to assume office was Ronald Reagan.
The longest-lived president was Gerald Ford, who died at the age of 93 years and 165 days.
Ronald Reagan was the second longest-lived, only 45 days short of Ford.
The next in line to surpass this is George H. W. Bush, who will surpass Reagan if he is still alive on October 11, 2017.
The shortest-lived president was John F. Kennedy, who died at the age of 46 years and 177 days.
Kennedy was born only 1415 days after Gerald Ford, the longest-lived president.
Ford's lifespan exceeds twice that of Kennedy by another 177 days.
Barack Obama was elected president on November 4, 2008.
On January 20, 2009, the date of his inauguration, he became the fifth-youngest person to ascend to the Presidency, at 47 years, 5 months and 16 days old.
Theodore Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy, Bill Clinton and Ulysses S. Grant, in that order, were younger than Obama when they took the oath of office; Grover Cleveland was slightly older (see table below).
