topic detection and tracking, and clustering

Build ontologies with Wikipedia:
Syed 2008 uses Wikipedia as a topic ontology for describing documents. It might be related to my clustering. Makes use of articles, cateogry and link graphs.
Syed 2010 introduces Wikitology. augments it with RDF data from DBpedia. 

Nguyen 2007 uses Wikipedia for entity allocation and identicication, uses alternatives of NER and coref tool, classifies relationships using SVM. But exactly what did they make use of?
Blohm 2008 discusses their version of Semantic MediaWiki to automatically extract additional annotation and make it verified by the users.

To detect vandalism:
Smets et al. 2008 used ML to detect vandalism attempts (compare it to Druck 2008). They say elementary features that current approaches are using are not sufficient and need to make use of the semantics of a revision. 
Druck 2008 discusses how to adopt discriminative probabilistic models to predict the quality of recent edits.


Pedro et al 2008 from CMU introduces Okinet, Wikipedia-based medical ontologies. They mined Wikipedia to automatically create medical ontologies.
Sorg and Cimiano tried to automatically induce cross-language links applying classification.
Wu, Hoffmann, and Weld 2008 augments low represented articles with sentences from Web pages. They try to create or complete infoboxes, building upon Kylin.

Nelken and Yamangil 2008 uses revision history to correct lexical errors (eggcorns), training sentence compression, text summarization system.
Yasuda and Sumida uses Wikipedia articles to build sentence-aligned corpora.
Nastase and Strube decodes Wikipedia cateogries to extract semantic relations and evaluated the results against ResearchCyc.
