Paranormal Activity is a 2009 mockumentary horror film written and directed by Oren Peli.
The movie premiered at the Screamfest Film Festival in US on October 14, 2007, and at the Slamdance Film Festival on January 18, 2008.
The movie is currently in limited release in several cities in the United States as of October of 2009.
The movie centers on a young couple, Katie and Micah, who are haunted by a supernatural presence in their home.
The movie is presented through the camera set up by the couple to capture the paranormal activity.
Synopsis
The movie begins with Micah testing out and playing with his camera.
He talks about what they're going to do and how weird things have been happening in the house.
A psychic is called in and learns from Katie that she has been haunted by a ghostly entity since her youth.
The psychic informs the couple that they are being plagued, not by a ghost, but by a demon.
The psychic explains that the demon feeds off negative energy so the couple must do their best not to antagonize it or give it reason to grow by way of being at each other's throats.
Micah continues his project.
A camera is set up in the bedroom and, every night, it captures what happens as they sleep.
There are some nights when nothing happens but, soon, minor things begin to occur.
The bedroom door moves by itself and the lights turn on in the hallway on their own.
Micah even finds strange tracks in baby powder that he smears on the floor prior to sleeping.
Micah uses a Ouija board to speak with the paranormal, much to Katie's disapproval.
They argue and go outside of the house.
While they're gone, the board begins to spell words on it's own and catches on fire.
A strange image is burned into the board when Micah and Katie return.
Things escalate as the couple hears a loud bang and then a door slams.
Going to investigate this, Micah finds the attic door open inside the house.
He goes up to the attic and finds a photo of Katie from when she was young.
Katie is shocked to see the photo and says it's impossible for that photo to be in the house because it was burned to ash in a fire that consumed a home she lived in prior to this.
Strange things continue to happen to Katie at night.
Sometimes, Katie will get out of bed and stand right next to the bed for hours, doing nothing but staring but never remembers herself doing this.
She does this one night and ends up outside on a swing where Micah finds her but she doesn't remember it the next morning.
The nights become more chilling as the sheets on their bed begin moving by themselves.
One night, Katie is yanked and dragged screaming out of bed by an invisible force and down the hall.
Micah has to give chase and forceably take her back.
The next day, Micah notices bruises on Katie's skin and a large mark that resembles a bite from an unknown source.
The activity soon begins to occur during the day, indicating the presence in the home is getting stronger.
During one afternoon, a photo of Micah and Katie is smashed, with most of the damage done to Micah's side of the portrait.
They make plans to go to a hotel that night, hoping that the being won't follow immediately.
But later on that day, Micah finds Katie sitting on the floor in a daze with her back against the wall, gripping a crucifix tightly in her hand.
Micah helps her up and notices blood on her hands and leg from the crucifix.
Micah soon tells Katie to get their things together so they can leave the house.
But Katie now refuses, saying that she wants to stay.
She tells Micah to trust her and that "everything will be fine from now on".
Her voice splitting into hers and that of another entity when she says this.
Afterwards, she gives a disturbing smile to the camera.
That night, they are seen sleeping and the droning noise starts again in the background.
Katie suddenly sits bolt up right, she then gets out of bed and turns to stare at the bed.
The sheet slowly pulls off Micah then Katie moves around the bed and stands there staring at him for 2 hours.
At about 3:35 am she moves to the bedroom door and exits going down the stairs into the darkness.
Katie screams for Micah and he jumps up out of the bed.
As he exits and hits the stair case, it becomes lower in pitch like a more male but demonic tone.
From here, nothing is seen but the bedroom and dark hallway through the door.
The audience can only hear the activity downstairs.
Katie continues to scream, some struggling is heard, and then dead silence.
Moments later, footsteps are heard but are heavier sounding as if something heavy is going to appear.
Suddenly, Micah's body is hurled towards the camera.
He collides with the camera and both fall to the ground, Micah doesn't move.
Katie is seen standing in the doorway with blood on her shirt.
She gets on the ground and crawls to Micah's body and, like an animal, sniffs at him.
She sees the camera and smiles at it eerily, her face contorted and evil, appearing as though she has been possessed by whatever haunts the house.
Katie lunges toward the camera with a loud scream, her face looking demonic in nature and the screen fades to black.
An epilogue title card reveals that Micah's body was discovered by authorities a few days later but that Katie was never seen again.
Alternate endings
Several blogs and news outlets are reporting that the ending currently being seen in theaters for the limited screenings does not match endings previously seen in earlier screenings at Screamfest and the Burbank screening.
However, outside of the blogosphere (which go off independent viewer reports), neither of the two alternate endings can be confirmed.
Fangoria's review of the film does, however, feature a frame from one of the alternate endings wherein a catatonic Katie is seen sitting, alone, next to the bed in the bedroom after the apparent murder of Micah downstairs.
Most of the reviewers express some discontent and disappointment with the ending but say that, while it is contradictory to the build-up and more conventional, it does work within the framework of the film.
Production
The idea for the film came about when Oren Peli began to experience "weird things" at the home in which he was living and wondered what would happen if he were to set up cameras to capture what happened as he slept at night.
The vulnerability of being asleep, he reasoned, tapped into a human being's most primal fear, stating, "If something is lurking in your home there's not much you can do about it".
Peli, himself, had been afraid of ghosts his entire life, even fearing the movie Ghostbusters, but intended to channel that fear into something positive and productive.
Peli took a year to prep his own house for shooting, going so far as to repaint the walls, add furniture, put in a carpet, and build an actual stairwell.
A very pleasant side effect, he joked, was ending up with a "dream home with a big TV".
In this time, he also did extensive research into paranormal phenomena and demonology, stating, "We wanted to be as truthful as we could be".
The reason for making the ghost in the story a demon was a result of the research pointing to the most malevolent and violent entities being "demons".
Focusing on believability and authenticity and believing that "atmosphere and a slow plot build" were more important than "over-the-top" action and gore, Peli chose to shoot the picture with a hand-held home video camera.
In deciding on a more raw and stationary format (the camera was almost always sitting on a tripod or something else) and erasing the need for a camera crew, a "higher degree of plausibility" was created for the audience as they were "more invested in the story and the characters".
Peli says that the dialogue was "natural" because there was no real script.
Instead, the actors were given outlines of the story and situations similar to The Blair Witch Project.
In casting the movie, Peli auditioned "a few hundred people" before finally meeting actress Katie Featherston and actor Micah Sloat.
He originally auditioned them individually and then called them back so that they could audition together.
Peli was impressed with the chemistry the actors showed saying, "If you saw the [audition] footage, you would've thought they had known each other for years".
Armed with a budget of $15,000 and a hand-held video camera and having no formal film training, Peli began shooting.
The film was shot out of sequence due to the time constraints (a self-imposed 7-day shooting schedule) even though the director wanted the story to unfold for the actors as he had envisioned it.
"It was a very intense week," Peli recalled, stating that the film would be shot day and night, edited at the same time, and would have the visual effects applied to it as the footage was being finalized by the actors who Peli called, "unbelievably professional and smart" throughout, adding that they surpassed being actors and became true "storytellers".
One week later, filming was completed.
Post-production and delays
After the film was finished, Peli signed with the Creative Artists Agency.
They screened the movie in 2007 at the Screamfest Horror Film Festival and, as a result, began to give away DVDs to anybody who would be willing to distribute it.
It didn't see a spotlight until 2007 when Miramax Films Senior Executive Jason Blum and his producing partner, Steven Schneider, viewed the movie for themselves.
Working with Blum, Peli edited the film down so that it ran tighter and smoother but more problems arose: Sundance Film Festival would not accept the film and even though the Slamdance Film Festival did, no distributor picked up the movie for major distribution.
In 2008, the DVD ended up at DreamWorks and was viewed by Production Executive Ashley Brooks.
Brooks was so impressed by the movie that she "pestered" her boss, Production Chief Adam Goodman, every day to see the film until he eventually saw it.
Goodman, in turn, brought it to his boss, Studio Chief Stacey Snider.
They were impressed by the film as well and handed the DVD to Steven Spielberg, who took it home to watch.
In a strange twist, Spielberg allegedly returned to DreamWorks the next day with the DVD in a "garbage bag" because he thought the DVD was "haunted".
According to Spielberg, minutes after he viewed the film, his bedroom doors "locked by themselves" and he couldn't get out without calling in a locksmith.
Despite this, Spielberg loved the movie and helped to greenlight a remake to be produced by Jason Blum and directed by Oren Peli again.
"They didn't know what to do with [the movie]," Blum stated about the remake, adding that they just wanted to be "in business" with Peli.
The original deal for the movie stipulated that Oren Peli would direct and that the DVD would have the original film included with it so the public would get an idea of what the original film was about.
However, during contract negotiations, Blum and Peli negotiated a one-time screening into the contract to see how a real audience would react to the original film.
As part of the deal, Adam Goodman invited several screenwriters to the screening so that they could get an idea about what to write and see what should be added and subtracted to the remake's script.
During the screening, viewers began to walk out of the theater.
Goodman was afraid that he made the wrong decision and that the screening was a bomb until he learned (in a twist reminiscent of the famous screening of 1979's Alien) that the viewers were actually truly frightened by the film.
It was at this point that Goodman canned all thoughts of a Hollywood remake and decided to release Peli's version of the film.
The film was supposed to be released in 2008 but was delayed further because of the rift between DreamWorks and Paramount Pictures.
While the movie was stuck in limbo, Oren Peli and Jason Blum screened the film for international buyers at a theater in Santa Monica along with a sold-out crowd mostly of teenagers.
This further cemented the film's reputation and Peli and Blum sold the international rights to 52 different countries.
The buzz generated by this and the positive word-of-mouth finally pushed Adam Goodman (who took over as Paramount's main exec) to release the film on the fall schedule.
Release
On September 25, 2009, Paramount Pictures decided to release the movie in 13 different "college towns" across the United States.
On his website, director Oren Peli invited internet users to "demand" where the film went next by voting on eventful.com.
While the Eventful Demand service has primarily been used to drum up interest in music concerts, it has also been used for numerous other types of events including political rallies, book signings, poetry readings, lectures, celebrity appearances, and film screenings by independent film producers.
The release of this movie marked the first time a major motion picture studio had used the service to virally market a film.
The movie managed to sell out 12 of the 13 showings.
On September 27, 2009, The L.A. Times Blog reported that Paramount was planning on releasing the film in several other markets based on the success of the initial limited release of the film.
On September 28, 2009, Paramount confirmed this report by issuing a press release on Oren Peli's official website.
The press release announced that the release of the film would expand to 20 other markets as of Friday, October 2nd, 2009.
This list included large-market cities that were excluded from the initial limited release such as New York.
On October 3, 2009, it was reported that a total of 33 screenings in all 20 markets sold out and that the movie had made $500,000 domestically.
A day later, Paramount Pictures announced that the film will have a full limited release in 40 markets, playing at all hours which include the midnight shows as well.
The full limited release of the film will start on Friday, October 9, 2009.
The film will get its UK release on 27 November, 2009.
On Tuesday, October 6th, Paramount and Eventful.com announced that the movie would be released nationwide if the movie got 1,000,000 "demands".
On Saturday, October 10th at around 1:35 a.m. Eastern Time, the counter hit over 1,000,000 requests.
Paramount Pictures then announced later in the day that the film would get a wide domestic release on Friday, October 16.
Critical reception
Based on 62 reviews collected by Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an overall approval rating from critics of 89%, with an average score of 7.2/10.
It also has a 78 "Generally favorable reviews" rating, with a 8.9 out of 10 user rating at Metacritic.
AOL reports that viewers left the screening mid-film not because they were dissatisfied, but because the film was so frightening.
The same article mentioned that the film may be rising to the same acclaim as The Blair Witch Project, filmed using the same video camera technique and because there was no real script per se.
Movie critic James Berardinelli awarded it 3.5 stars out of a maximum of 4 stars.
Box office performance
The film opened on September 25, 2009 to 12 theaters taking $36,146 on its opening day and $77,873 on its first weekend.
It took more success when it opened to 33 theaters on October 1, 2009 doubling the box office reception, grossing over $100,000, eventually going on to total $933,080 at the domestic box office.
As it expanded to 159 theaters on the October 9-11 weekend, it grossed more than $2,500,000 on Friday with a $15,000+ per-theater average.
It went on to gross over $7,000,000 in the weekend, having grossed about $44,000 per theater, coming in at #5 at the box office.
