Choose sentences to describe a whole cluster
(1) Pick the main article from the cluster
    => K-means centroid
    => most viewed during that period
    => the article that is most linked to by the other page
(2) Choose the best sentence from the main article
    => Using our closest date heuristic, resolving pronouns
    => Make sure that the sentence includes the entity that the article describes.
(3) Choose sentences that describe pairs of articles:
	< Main article, other article in the cluster >
	=> sentence should mention both entities
	=> sentence can be taken from either page
	=> date may not be important

Just met with Chris. We talked about technical details about how to tackle the issues of doing things written above (for Oct 8).
1. Make a separate file that has meta information about links for each article sentences file.
2. Regard any instance of the string that is part of a link as a link to the corresponding linked article.
3. For each sentence in any output that has a reference to sentences, attach the sentence index.

Make the draft for the paper more polished and bring the printout to the next meeting.
