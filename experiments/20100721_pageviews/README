Overview
========
Taking as input the list of the Wikipedia current events, print the page views of each link.
Most of the description are copied from the README file of the 20100705_pageviews experiments.

Note that the following points are different from the previous experiments.
1. Two different output formats are tested. The details are explained at the output section.
2. The daily statistics used are the ones preprocessed with the redirect pages data.

Command
=======
nohup time java -cp wikitrends.jar -Xmx100g wikitrends.Convert /home/bahn/for_ccb/events_link_2009 ../en_redir_daily &

Input
=====
events_link_2009
    currently /data/events/events_links_2009.
    The list of the links in the Wikipedia current events.
    The format is as follows:

    date event_serial_no link

    Each line contains the date of the event, the index of the event, and a link from the event, separated by a space.
    The examples are below:

20090101 0 BART_Police_shooting_of_Oscar_Grant
20090101 0 California
20090101 0 Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit
20090101 0 Fruitvale_%28BART_station%29
20090101 1 Israel
20090101 1 Jabalia
20090101 1 Gaza_Strip
20090101 1 Hamas
20090101 1 Nizar_Rayan
20090101 1 2008%E2%80%932009_Israel%E2%80%93Gaza_conflict
...

../en_redir_daily
    the directory in which the daily page view statistics reside.
    Note that statistics are processed according to redirect pages.

Output
======
Two different output formats were tested. Basically, both the two formats are JSON-compatible, and contain the date-pageviews pairs. Only the difference between the two are in the date format used.
The output is written in the standard output. The example is as follows.

1.
["14th_Dalai_Lama", [["20081201", 2112], ..., ["20091231", 1811]]]

2.
["14th_Dalai_Lama", [["12/1/2008", 2112], ..., ["12/31/2009", 1811]]]

Scripts
=======
cut

For each line in the output is too long, it cuts each line at the column 80 to show it more handily.
