A video game of the same name will be released in March/April for the PSP.
Plot
Two thousand years ago, the evil Namekian warlord Piccolo (James Marsters) descended upon the Earth during a solar eclipse and attempted to destroy the world with the aid of his disciple, Oozaru.
A group of monks conjured the Mafuba—a powerful but life-threatening enchantment designed to bind those caught within it—and used it to imprison Piccolo.
Oozaru disappears, and the Earth gradually recovers.
In the present day, Piccolo escapes his imprisonment and begins searching for the legendary Dragonballs in order to make a wish to the magical dragon Shen Long.
On the night of his 18th birthday, a young high-school student and martial artist named Goku (Justin Chatwin), comes home from a party hosted by his crush Chi-Chi (Jamie Chung) to find his beloved grandfather Gohan (Randall Duk Kim) dying.
He was attacked by Piccolo who was seeking the 4-Star Dragonball.
Before he dies, Gohan tells Goku to find find the martial arts master Muten Roshi (Chow Yun-Fat).
Along the way, Goku meets Bulma Briefs (Emmy Rossum) of Capsule Corp.
Capsule held the 5-Star Dragonball, but it was stolen by Mai (Eriko Tamura), who serves Piccolo.
Goku offers Bulma his services in exchange for her help in finding Roshi.
They find him in Paozu City and Goku begins training to harness his Ki while Bulma tries to pinpoint the location of the 6-Star Dragonball.
They fall into a trap set by the desert bandit Yamcha (Joon Park), but Roshi convinces Yamcha to join them.
Together, the group fight their way to the Dragonball, but Mai takes the ball.
Roshi begins training to perform the Mafuba enchantment so he can reseal Picolo, while Goku must learn the most powerful of Ki techniques: the Kamehameha.
Mai disguises herself as Chi-Chi to take Goku's Dragonball.
Piccolo successfully unites the Dragonballs, but the group arrives in time to prevent him from summoning Shen Long.
During the battle, Goku learns that he had been sent to Earth as an infant to destroy it when he came of age.
As a solar eclipse begins, Goku transforms into Oozaru.
Roshi attempts to use the Mafuba, but is killed before Goku returns to his senses.
Furious, Piccolo creates a gigantic Ki ball to destroy the planet.
Goku performs the Kamehameha, and after a power struggle, Goku defeats Piccolo.
He uses the Dragonballs to request that Shen Long revive Roshi.
As they celebrate, they realize the Dragonballs have now scattered.
Bulma declares that they must seek the balls again.
Before they head out, Goku visits Chi-Chi to engage in a sparring match.
At the end of the film, a woman is tending Piccolo's wounds as he awakens.
Production
Development
In March 2002, 20th Century Fox acquired feature film rights to the Dragon Ball franchise.
In June 2004, Ben Ramsey, who wrote The Big Hit, was paid $500,000 to adapt Dragonball Z.
In 2007, James Wong and Stephen Chow were announced as director and producer respectively, and the project was retitled Dragonball.
Wong rewrote the script.
The first full color image of Justin Chatwin as Goku was released in the 24th issue of Weekly Young Jump.
Chow was a Dragon Ball fan, citing its "airy and unstrained story [which] leaves much room for creation", but explained he would only serve as producer because he believes that he should only direct stories he had created.
87Eleven, the stunt performance company that worked on The Matrix and 300, is working on the film.
Ariel Shaw, who worked on Wong's entries in the Final Destination series and 300, is visual effects supervisor.
Robert MacLachlan, who also worked on Wong's Final Destination films, serves as cinematographer.
The film was originally slated to be named Dragonball, however on December 10, 2008, a trailer was released using the name Dragonball Evolution and Fox licensed the domain name "DragonballEvolutionMovie.com" indicating the film had been renamed.
Differing costs to produce the film have been reported.
In January 2008, Masters told TV Guide the film had a budget of $100 million.
In April 2009, the Spanish television station Telecinco reported that the budget was $50 million.
Casting
Justin Chatwin was selected to play the film's central character Goku.
Ron Perlman was originally offered the role of the villain Lord Piccolo, but turned it down to work on Hellboy II: The Golden Army.
James Marsters, who accepted the role, noted he was a fan of the original anime series, describing it as "the coolest television cartoon in the last 50,000 years [because] it’s got a Shakespearean sense of good and evil".
Summarizing the original concept of Piccolo, he said the character was "thousands of years old and a very long time ago he used to be a force of good, but [he] got into a bad argument and was put into prison for 2000 years.
It got him very angry, and he finds a way to escape and then tries to destroy the world".
Originally, Piccolo was going to be depicted as a handsome creature, but Marsters and the make-up artist chose to give him a decrepit complexion to reflect his having been trapped for thousands of years.
The first time the make-up was applied, it took seventeen hours and left Marsters with difficulty breathing.
In subsequent applications, it generally only took four hours.
Stephen Chow originally wanted to cast Zhang Yuqi, whom he worked with on CJ7, for the part of Chi Chi, but the role eventually went to Jamie Chung
Filming
Shooting began on December 3, 2007, in Mexico City, Mexico.
Locations included the Universidad Tecnológica de México.
From January 2, 2008, the crew shot at Durango.
The crew moved to Estado de México in March of that year for some shots at Nevado de Toluca.
Shooting has also been scheduled at Los Angeles, California.
In adapting the Dragon Ball manga, the futuristic cities and flying vehicles were kept, however, the anthropomorphic creatures and talking animals (such as Turtle, Oolong and Puar) were dropped.
Many of the locations are very Oriental, and there will be some Aztec influence too, particularly from their temples.
It was thought that Rossum would wear a blue wig to resemble her anime counterpart, but it was ultimately decided that such a look was too unrealistic.
Instead she will have her natural brown with blue streaks.
Chatwin will not wear a wig as the director felt Chatwin's hair resembled Goku's.
A large amount of Dragonball Evolution was shot in an abandoned jeans factory, also located in Durango, Mexico.
Dragonball Evolution special effects are being done by Amalgamated Dynamics, while the visual effects are being done by Ollin Studios, Zoic Studios, and Imagine Engine.
The film will also have the anime style of fighting in Dragon Ball Z, such as chi energy blasts and auras.
Music
On December 9, 2008, it was confirmed that the theme song will be "Rule" by Japanese singer Ayumi Hamasaki.
The choice was because director James Wong wanted the movie adaptation of a manga/anime born in Japan to be sung by a Japanese person and he felt it would be good for the movie to get Hamasaki due to her massive popularity in Japan.
"Rule" will be used as the theme song for every country's release.
The score to Dragonball Evolution was composed by Brian Tyler, who recorded his score with an 82-piece ensemble of the Hollywood Studio Symphony at the Newman Scoring Stage at 20th Century Fox.
Release
Though an American film, Dragonball Evolution was released in Japan and other Asian countries on March 13, 2009, nearly a month before its American release.
It was released in Australia on April 2, 2009 and was released in the United Kingdom on April 8.
Its release in its home country has changed dates multiple time.
Initially scheduled to be released in North America on August 15, 2008, it was later moved to April 2009 to allow time to do additional filming and post-production work.
The specific date has changed back and forth between April 10 and April 8, with the final release date being April 10.
Reception
On its opening weekend in the United States, the film grossed $4,756,488 ranking #8 at the box office.
As of April 14, 2009, its worldwide gross had reached $42,533,529.
Since its release, Dragonball: Evolution has received mixed reviews from critics.
Zac Bertschy of Anime News Network, originally disgusted at otaku who decried the film via leaked set shots and trailers before the movie's release, gave the movie an overall failing grade and stated "the fans were right".
He criticized the film's lack of explaining plot elements, its hackneyed storyline and lackluster effort by the actors.
Variety's Russell Edwards found the film "passable", noting it "doesn't take itself too seriously, but avoids campiness".
Luke Thompson of E!
Online referred to the film as a "surreal mess" that would only make sense to fans of the original series.
He questioned the use of a Caucasian in the main role and felt Chow Yun-Fat was "overacting like never before", but did consider it "fun in a train-wreck kind of way" and that while it was never boring it was also never "logical, coherent, rational".
Christoper Monfette of IGN gave the film a more favorable review, stating that it "is perhaps the most successful live-action film to date to utilize costume, production and audio design – not to mention some inspired fight choreography – to provide the flavor of anime without becoming overly cartoonish".
He praised the main cast for "creating characters the audience can actually care about" and felt Chatwin was particularly likeable as Goku.
Slant Magazine s Rob Humanick considered the film "uninspired" and implausible with an "aimlessly hyperactive construction and complete lack of substance" and "cobbled-together FX fakery".
Reviewing the film for Australia's ABC Radio National, Jason Di Rosso stated the film was "lacking the visual panache of recent graphic novel adaptations".
He agreed the film was uninspired and also felt it had dull "high school movie banter" dialog and was "cliché-ridden".
The Village Voice s Aaron Hillis called the film a "loony live-action adaptation", but felt it was "more entertaining than it deserves to be" and would likely appeal to ten-year old boys.
Alonso Duralde of MSNBC found the film to be "both entertainingly ridiculous and ridiculously entertaining" and noted that "kids will have such a blast that you can turn this movie into the gateway kung-fu drug that makes them want to watch the earlier work of Stephen Chow and Chow Yun-Fat".
Jeffrey K. Lyles of The Gazette found the film to be "a fairly entertaining martial arts adventure for the younger audiences" and tolerable to adults.
He felt Chatwin was ill-cast as Goku, and that director Wong failed to capture the "frenetic sense of the anime" in the action scenes, leaving them an effort to understand.
