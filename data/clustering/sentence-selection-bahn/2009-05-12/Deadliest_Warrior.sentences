Deadliest Warrior is a television program on Spike in which historical warriors are pit against each other in simulated battles.
Each episode showcases two warriors in a hypothetical battle to the death.
Each warrior is given weapons from the particular group they are associated.
Modern fighters and experts on said weapons present the strengths, and weaknesses of each arsenal, including real tests of the weapons.
The data collected is then fed into a computer simulation based on an unreleased commercial game engine developed by Slitherine Strategies to determine the average winner of one thousand battles.
After the winner is determined, a mock battle takes place to showcase how each weapon is used in a real battle situation, and to determine which combatant is the deadliest warrior.
Geoff Desmoulin is the scientist and high speed camera operator.
Dr. Armand Dorian is the medical consultant.
Max Geiger is the simulations programmer.
All three provide color commentary throughout the show, as well as technical details of each weapons test.
Format of the show
Each episode of the show begins with the introduction of the two warriors.
The history and culture of each is discussed briefly.
These segments are fleshed out with actors performing dramatized scenes from the daily life of the warriors.
A team of "experts" is then introduced to showcase and test the chosen weapons for the battle.
The weapons are presented in four categories: short range, mid range, long range, and special.
Special weapons are usually the signature weapon of the warrior, for example, the Apache war club, or the Spartan shield.
The experts test the weapons on body parts (and sometimes entire torsos) constructed out of ballistics gel, as well as large amounts of stage blood, which adds to the theatrics of the testing.
Sometimes the torsos are covered with armor that is representative of that worn by the weapon's opponent.
Natural tissue, particularly pig carcasses, are also frequently used.
All of the images are captured with high speed photography, and the results are fed into a computer which determines the damage the weapons are able to deal.
The weapons with similar characteristics are paired against each other and the winner of each pairing is determined by a combination of the damage results from the tests and the judgements of the producers and hosts.
After the arsenal has been tested, the warriors fight a one on one hypothetical battle that demonstrates some possible scenarios and the eventual winner, which is performed by actors.
After the battle, the winner is revealed as the average victor of one thousand simulated battles.
The number of times a particular weapon dealt the killing blow is also revealed as well as the opinion of the producers as to why the stated warrior won.
Response and Deadliest Warrior Aftermath
The show proved to be an immediate success, averaging 1.7 million viewers after just three episodes.
After week 3 of the show a web series on Spike.com was created and named Deadliest Warrior-The Aftermath.
Produced in a roundtable format, it serves as a sort of liason between the opinions of those watching the show and its producers.
During the show the producers focus on a specific matchup and debate the issues raised by viewers that pertain to the episode.
It adresses some of the percieved inconsistencies for the show as well as provides commentary from contributors such as Max Geiger and experts in specific fighting styles.
