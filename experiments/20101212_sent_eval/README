Overview
========

This experiment is to evaluate the varioius sentence selection scheme.
#The description about this experiment is in the readme.tex file.
#which readme.tex file?
The gold standard is Ben's sentence selection.

The kinds of selection scheme:

First: Select the first sentence.
Recent: Select the sentence with the most recent date.
Self: Select the sentence with the most recent date and a refernce to itself.
Edit: Select the sentence in the recent edit history.

Future Work
===========
- take care of 'him'.
- Implement Edit.
- Add features and combinations of features:
  - Edit history
  - topic of the article
  - link structure

Data
====
Note that Ben did not select any sentence for the
data/manual/2009-02-10/Jessica_Simpson.sentences file.

There are some files that the corresponding APF files do not exist.
		# ../../data/serif/2009-02-10/E_Street_Band.sentences.sgm.apf does not exist
		# ../../data/serif/2009-02-10/Heroes_(TV_series).sentences.sgm.apf does not exist
		# ../../data/serif/2009-02-10/Lily_Allen.sentences.sgm.apf does not exist
		# ../../data/serif/2009-04-19/Deadpool.sentences.sgm.apf does not exist
		# ../../data/serif/2009-05-12/Deadpool.sentences.sgm.apf does not exist
		# ../../data/serif/2009-05-12/Scrubs_(TV_series).sentences.sgm.apf does not exist

There are some APF files that Python's XML module cannot parse. These are probably caused by the files' being terminated in an immature fashion.

Scripts
=======

There are three kinds of scripts: data generation, preprocess, and evaluation.
There is a script to see if an apf file is parsable with Python's xml.dom.parse:
non_parsable.py
	An example usage of this script:
		$ for file in ../../data/serif/2009-01-27/*.apf; do ./non_parsable.py $file; done

Data Generation
---------------
These scripts generate test data according to the schemes.
The generated data are located in the data/clustering/sent directory.

First:
		src/serif/batch_pick_first.sh ../../data/sent/manual/2009-01-27 ../../data/sent/auto-first/2009-01-27

Recent:
I ran the command line below to generate the test data for the first date.
		cd src/serif; ./batch_pick_recent_dates.sh ../../data/serif/2009-01-27 2009-01-27 ../../data/sent/auto-recent/2009-01-27

The following command line is for the remaining four dates.
The error & warning messages occurred. I have to find for which file the error occurred.
		cd src/serif; for DATE in 2009-02-10 2009-04-19 2009-05-12 2009-10-12; do mkdir -p ../../data/sent/auto-recent/$DATE; ./batch_pick_recent_dates.sh ../../data/serif/$DATE $DATE ../../data/sent/auto-recent/$DATE; done

These are the list of the files that did not exist.
		# ../../data/serif/2009-02-10/E_Street_Band.sentences.sgm.apf does not exist
		# ../../data/serif/2009-02-10/Heroes_(TV_series).sentences.sgm.apf does not exist
		# ../../data/serif/2009-02-10/Lily_Allen.sentences.sgm.apf does not exist
		# ../../data/serif/2009-04-19/Deadpool.sentences.sgm.apf does not exist
		# ../../data/serif/2009-05-12/Deadpool.sentences.sgm.apf does not exist
		# ../../data/serif/2009-05-12/Scrubs_(TV_series).sentences.sgm.apf does not exist

This file was not parsable with Python's xml.dom.minidom.parse module:
		data/serif/2009-04-19/Fast_&_Furious.sentences.sgm.apf

For the data in data/sent/auto-recent, coreference resolution did not work. So I fixed the script and rerun again.
		cd src/serif; for DATE in 2009-01-27 2009-02-10 2009-04-19 2009-05-12 2009-10-12; do mkdir -p ../../data/sent/auto-recent2/$DATE; ./batch_pick_recent_dates.sh ../../data/serif/$DATE $DATE ../../data/sent/auto-recent2/$DATE; done

The following script are the difference between coreference resolution and one without it.
		(data/sent/auto-recent)
		for DIR in *; do diff $DIR ../auto-recent2/$DIR; done | less

I changed coreference resolution and the data are in data/sent/auto-recent3.

Found that the following files are missing in data/sent/auto-recent and copied them from auto-recent3.
		Only in ../auto-recent3/2009-01-27: Bill_Clinton.sentences
		Only in ../auto-recent3/2009-01-27: Franklin_D._Roosevelt.sentences
		Only in ../auto-recent3/2009-01-27: Theodore_Roosevelt.sentences

Later, deleted auto-recent2 and renamed auto-recent3 to auto-recent2.
		$ rm -rf auto-recent2
		$ git mv auto-recent3 auto-recent2

Self:
The script was to select the sentence with both the most recent date and a self reference.
		cd src/serif; for DATE in 2009-01-27 2009-02-10 2009-04-19 2009-05-12 2009-10-12; do mkdir -p ../../data/sent/auto-self/$DATE; ./batch_pick_self.sh ../../data/serif/$DATE $DATE ../../data/sent/auto-self/$DATE; done

But it did not perform well, so I changed the script so that if there is no such sentence, it backs off to RECENT.
		cd src/serif; for DATE in 2009-01-27 2009-02-10 2009-04-19 2009-05-12 2009-10-12; do mkdir -p ../../data/sent/auto-self2/$DATE; ./batch_pick_self.sh ../../data/serif/$DATE $DATE ../../data/sent/auto-self2/$DATE; done

Preprocess
----------
Print the line number of the selected sentences for evaluation.

				149 In applying the ecclesiastical rules, Christian Churches use March 21 as the starting point in determining the date of Easter, from which they find the next full moon, etc.
				165 It fell on March 23 in 2008, but will not do so again until 2160.
				11 After several centuries of disagreement, all churches accepted the computation of the Alexandrian Church (now the Coptic Church) that Easter is the first Sunday after the Paschal Full Moon, which is the first moon whose 14th day (the ecclesiastic "full moon") is on or after March 21 (the ecclesiastic "vernal equinox").
				10 Easter falls each year on a Sunday between March 22 and April 25 inclusive (April 4 and May 8 in Eastern Christianity), following the cycle of the Moon.
				124 In Western Christianity, using the Gregorian calendar, Easter always falls on a Sunday between March 22 and April 25 inclusively.
