The fifth season of the American serial drama television series Lost commenced airing on the ABC network in the United States and on CTV and A-Channel in Canada in January 2009, and will conclude in May 2009.
The season continues the stories of the survivors of the fictional crash of Oceanic Airlines Flight 815, after some of them are rescued and those still stranded seemingly disappear to an unknown location and time with the island that they inhabit.
According to Lost's co-creator/executive producer/writer/show runner Damon Lindelof, the season "is about why [the people who have left the island] need to get back".
While the island stories of episodes of prior seasons were intercut with flashbacks or flashforwards of a featured character, the fifth season will be presented differently with part of each episode taking place off the island and the other part following characters on the island in a different time.
Lost returned on January 21, 2009 on ABC with a three-hour premiere consisting of a clip-show and two back-to-back new episodes.
The remainder of the season will air on Wednesdays at 9:00 P.M.
The season began in the UK and Ireland on Sunday January 25, 2009 on Sky1 and RTÉ Two, respectively.

Also returning are crash survivor James "Sawyer" Ford (Josh Holloway), former Other Dr. Juliet Burke (Elizabeth Mitchell) and Miles Straume (Ken Leung) and Charlotte Lewis (Rebecca Mader), members of the science team from a freighter offshore, who are at the survivors' beach camp with the majority of the crash survivors.
Another member of the science team named Daniel Faraday (Jeremy Davies) is on an inflatable boat just offshore of the island as it disappears.
John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) leaves his fellow crash survivors to become the new leader of the Others and is last seen dead in a coffin (under the name Jeremy Bentham) in flashforwards to three years into the future.
Jin Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim), who was aboard the freighter which exploded, remains a main character.
Furthermore, those who previously received star billing, but will not in season five, include Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin), who follows an apparition of her deceased father into the forest and later appears in a moving cabin that is home to a semi-invisible man on the island and Michael Dawson (Harold Perrineau), who died when the freighter exploded.
Emilie de Ravin, who plays Claire, will not return as part of the main cast in the fifth season, however, she will appear in season five in a recurring capacity and return as a main cast member in season six.
Furthermore, Malcolm David Kelley, who portrays Walt Lloyd, Michael's son, will also appear in the fifth season.
Five guest stars have confirmed that they are returning: Nestor Carbonell appears as the apparently ageless Richard Alpert in nine episodes, while Cheech Marin returned in the second episode as Hurley's father David Reyes, François Chau portrays Dharma Initiative scientist Dr. Pierre Chang, Grant Bowler will return as the late captain Gault and Lance Reddick will continue to appear as the mysterious Matthew Abaddon.
Several other recurring stars have been confirmed to appear in season five: Sonya Walger plays Desmond's girlfriend, Penny Widmore; William Mapother portrays deceased Other Ethan Rom; Jeff Fahey returns as pilot Frank Lapidus; and L. Scott Caldwell and Sam Anderson continue to play married couple Rose Henderson and Bernard Nadler, respectively.
According to Entertainment Weekly's Michael Ausiello, guest stars Alan Dale and John Terry will continue to respectively guest star as billionaire Charles Widmore and deceased Christian Shephard, but may be promoted to the main cast for the sixth season.
Second season main cast member Michelle Rodriguez returned in the second episode as the deceased Ana Lucia Cortez.
The writers are also scheduling an appearance by dead islander Danielle Rousseau.
The producers have stated that Vincent, a dog who survived the crash and lives on the island will be alive and well through to the series' conclusion.
Ausiello has reported on the casting of new characters, but Lost's producers have been known to disguise their new characters during casting with fake names and occupations.
Two characters tentatively referred to as "Caesar" and "Ilanna" or "Ilana" will be introduced in the premiere as guest stars, but may be upgraded to the main cast in their second season.
Caesar, to be played by Saïd Taghmaoui, is in his late thirties or early forties, is "dangerous, physical and extremely intelligent" with a "dark past" and is "as skillful at charming people as he is at killing them".
Ilana, who is in her late twenties or early thirties, has a "pivotal role" and is smart, dangerous, alluring and "used to getting her own way" will be played by Zuleikha Robinson.
Two other recurring characters introduced in the premiere are the attractive Asian "Martha" and the antagonistic, expensive and sometimes friendly attorney "Dan", who has a "real menace lurking below the surface".
Tom Irwin portrays Dan Norton, an attorney who is tasked with performing a maternity test on Kate and Aaron, while Leslie Ishii portrays "Martha", Dr. Chang's wife.
Ausiello has also reported that Raymond J. Barry will portray Jack's grandfather.
Furthermore, TV Guide has reported that Reiko Aylesworth will guest-star in at least four episodes.
Aylesworth will play Amy, who, according to the Hollywood Reporter, is a “smart and successful professional woman with a love for the outdoors who is looking for the right man".
It was later reported that Amy is a member of the Dharma Initiative.
Sean Whalen, who previously portrayed Neil Frogurt in the Lost: Missing Pieces mobisodes, reprised his role in the first two episodes of season five.
Plot
Season five follows two primary storylines.
The first takes place on the island, which has been moved in both space and time by Ben, and focuses on the events that lead to Locke's death in 2007.
The second takes place off the island following Locke's death and deals with Jack and Ben's attempt to reunite the Oceanic Six and return to the island with Locke's dead body.
During production of the fourth season, Damon Lindelof said that "[the audience] think[s that] the show is, 'Okay, they're on the island, and then—whoosh [sound clip]—you're in the past or the future.
'  By the end of season four, I think the audience is going to go, 'How can the show continue to be that?
'  And they are absolutely right ...
There could easily be a time when the word flash becomes irrelevant".
Instead of using flashbacks and flashforwards as in previous seasons, stories throughout the fifth season will play out on and off the island at different points in time.
With this new storytelling structure, the backstories of Ben, Rousseau, Richard, Daniel and Miles will be further revealed, but not through flashbacks.
According to Carlton Cuse, the "mysterious things [that] happen … to Claire [in the final episodes of the fourth season] set up the next few ... years" of her storyline.
Some intended storylines were pushed back from the fourth season due to the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike.
Areas intended to be explored included the reason Libby (Cynthia Watros) was in the mental institution, why Ms. Hawking (Fionnula Flanagan) was in a photograph with Brother Campbell (Andrew Conolly), what happened between Ben and Henry Gale (the survivor of a hot air balloon crash whom Ben killed and impersonated) and how Ben was caught in Rousseau's trap in the second season episode titled "One of Them"  and the four-toed statue seen by Sayid, Jin and Sun.
