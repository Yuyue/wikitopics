========================

Things to do today:
	* Run K-means with tf-idf and cosine distance, KL-divergence, etc.
		* failed.
	* Figure out the current settings of K-means and LDA.
		* partly succeeded.
	* Make a list of the papers related to Wikipedia.
	* Improve sentence selection model with edit history.
	* Improve link structure-based clustering model.
	* Read Kristian's next paper following Automatic Generation of Story Highlights.
	* Considering drawing ROC curves for K-means and LDA clustering.
	* Read a paper of the papers on my reading list.

Current settings:
	Things I want to make sure:
		* romanization
		* tokenization
		* term weights
		* dimensions
	Ask Charley what her questions were.
	
	The settings for LDA:
		* keep-sequence: using a feature sequence rather than a feature vector
		* remove-stopwords: removing stop words. where is the list of the stop words used?
	The settings for K-means:
		* feature vector: a sure thing.
		* using cosine distance.
	Both are:
		* gotten rid of stop words.
		* normalized (lowercased) and tokenized.

Things I want to learn:
	* DET curves and ROC curves.
	* Chi-squared values
	* pairwise Kappa statistics.
	* calculating significance and alpha values.
	* Post-hoc Turkey test.
	
Read papers:
	* Allan's UMass system paper.
	* Lapata's generation of headlines and image caption paper.
