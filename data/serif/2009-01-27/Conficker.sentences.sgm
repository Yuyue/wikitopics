Conficker (aka Downup, Downadup and Kido) is a computer worm that surfaced in October 2008 that targets the Microsoft Windows operating system.
The worm exploits a known vulnerability in the Windows Server service used by Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008.
Origin of name
The name "Conficker" is a German pun, meaning "program that manipulates the configuration".
"Configuration" is typically abbreviated "config".
Conficker is constructed from the first five letters of "config.
while adding four letters to the end so as to end with "ficker," a vulgar nominalized form of the German transitive verb ficken, which is common German slang for sexual intercourse.
Operation
The Conficker worm spreads itself primarily through a buffer overflow vulnerability in the Server Service on Windows computers.
The worm uses a specially crafted RPC request to execute code on the target computer.
When executed on a computer, Conficker disables a number of system services such as Windows Automatic Update, Windows Security Center, Windows Defender and Windows Error Reporting.
It then connects to a server, where it receives further orders to propagate, gather personal information, and downloads and installs additional malware onto the victim's computer.
The worm also attaches itself to certain Windows processes such as svchost.exe, explorer.exe and services.exe.
Symptoms of infection
Account lockout policies being reset automatically.
Certain Microsoft Windows services such as Automatic Updates, Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS), Windows Defender and Error Reporting Services are automatically disabled.
Domain controllers respond slowly to client requests.
System network gets unusually congested.
This can be checked with network traffic chart on Windows Task Manager.
On websites related with antivirus software, Windows system updates cannot be accessed.
In addition, the worm launches a brute force dictionary attack against administrator passwords to help it spread through ADMIN$ shares, making choice of sensible passwords advisable.
Impact
The New York Times reported that it had infected 9 million PCs by 22 January 2009, while The Guardian estimated 3.5 million infected PCs.
By 16 January 2009, antivirus software vendor F-Secure reported that Conficker had infected almost 9 million PCs.
As of January 26 2009, Confiker had infected more than 15 million computers, making it one of the most widespread infections in recent times.
Conficker is reported to be one of the largest botnets created because 30 percent of Windows computers do not have the Microsoft Windows patch released in October 2008.
The U.K. Ministry of Defence reported that some of its major systems and desktops are infected.
The worm has spread across administrative offices, NavyStar/N* desktops aboard various Royal Navy warships and Royal Navy submarines, and Hospitals across the city of Sheffield reported infection of over 800 computers.
Experts say it is the worst infection since the SQL slammer (computer worm).
Patching and Removal
On 15 October 2008 Microsoft released a patch to fix the vulnerability.
Removal tools are available from Microsoft, Symantec and Kaspersky Lab.
Since the virus can spread via USB drives that trigger AutoRun, disabling the AutoRun feature for external media through modifying the Windows Registry is recommended.
While Microsoft has released patches for the later Windows XP Service Packs 2 and 3 and Windows 2000 SP4 and Vista, it has not released any patch for Windows XP Service Pack 1 or earlier versions (excluding Windows 2000 SP4), as the support period for these service packs has expired.
