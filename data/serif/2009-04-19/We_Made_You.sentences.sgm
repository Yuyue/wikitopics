"We Made You" is the first single by American rapper Eminem from his upcoming album Relapse.
The single, produced by Dr. Dre and with a chorus sung by singer Charmagne Tripp, was released on April 7, 2009 along with a music video.
"We Made You" was released to the radio on April 7, 2009, and was accompanied by a music video.
Reception
"We Made You" has received mixed reviews from critics.
Daniel Kreps of Rolling Stone magazine gave it a positive review stating, "It's nice to see Eminem goofing around again after a few years out of the spotlight during which he grappled with serious issues like the death of his friend Proof, and "We Made You" with its damnation of current celebrities will likely prove to be a solid pop cultural time capsule of this weird 2009 moment we're experiencing now".
Tim Jonze of The Guardian however, reported, "We Made You" is not Eminem doing what he does best.
Instead, it is merely him doing what he's done before.
Many times before.
There is clearly a huge personal story to be told on this record, but Eminem doesn't seem keen on telling it.
Instead we get the references to prescription drugs, the dissing of female celebrities and some infantile sound effects".
Political commentator Bill O'Reilly deemed the video "crude" for its depiction of Sarah Palin and anti-feminist lyrics, calling Eminem, "the lowest form of entertainment," and criticizing the "liberal" media for not expressing the same outrage.
Music video
The music video for "We Made You" premiered on April 7, 2009 at 6:00 AM on several MTV stations, as well as MTV.com.
The single's music video was directed by Joseph Kahn, who also shot "Without Me" from The Eminem Show.
The video was filmed in Las Vegas and features cameo appearances by Dr. Dre, 50 Cent, Kon Artis, Bobby Lee, The Palms hotel owner George Maloof, and pornographic actresses Trisha Paytas (playing Jessica Simpson) and Lisa Ann (playing Sarah Palin).
The casino-based sequence in the video is a homage to the film Rain Man, a film Eminem has previously referenced in his lyrics.
The casino scene was shot in The Palms hotel and casino.
On April 3, 2009, Eminem talked about the music video in an MTV News interview, stating that there is some "Celebrity bashing in it," which is often a feature of his album's lead singles.
Notable celebrities mocked include Jessica Simpson, Amy Winehouse, Britney Spears, Sarah Palin, Lindsay Lohan, Kim Kardashian and Ellen DeGeneres.
