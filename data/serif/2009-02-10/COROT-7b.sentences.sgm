COROT-Exo-7b is an exoplanet orbiting around the star CoRoT-Exo-7.
It was detected by the French-led COROT mission in 2009.
It is the smallest exoplanet to have its diameter measured, at 1.7 times that of the Earth.
Its mass is estimated to be 5–10 earth masses.
It orbits very close to its star with an orbital period of 20 hours.
The star, in the constellation Monoceros, is   away and is slightly smaller than the Sun.
Overview
The planet has a high surface temperature, between 1000 to 1500 °C.
Due to the high temperature, it may be covered in lava or water vapor.
The composition and density of the planet are still being examined, with one possibility being that it is rocky like Earth.
It may also belong to a class of planets that are thought to be made up of water vapor and rock in almost equal amounts.
The scientists are unsure whether it is an ocean planet, a kind of planet whose existence has yet to be proven so far.
In theory, such planets would initially be covered partially in ice and they would later drift towards their star, with the ice melting to cover it in liquid.
With an orbital period of just 20 hours, the planet has the shortest orbit yet seen in an extrasolar planet.
According to Suzanne Aigrain, a researcher at the University of Exeter who is part of the CoRoT team, the planet is much more earthlike than previously found exoplanets and probably has a solid surface somewhere.
Discovery
COROT-Exo-7b was found by the observation of a brightness change of its mother star, originating in a transit of the planet in front of the star (as seen from Earth).
The exact knowledge of the brightness difference, together with a size estimate for the star, allows one to calculate the planet's size.
The discovery of CoRoT-Exo-7b was announced on 3 February 2009, during the CoRoT Symposium 2009 in Paris.
It will be published in a forthcoming special issue of the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics dedicated to results from CoRoT.
The planet's current name is derived from the COROT mission, which stands for "COnvection ROtation and planetary Transits".
It is led by the French Space Agency CNES with involvement by the European Space Agency, Austria, Belgium, Germany, Spain, and Brazil.
