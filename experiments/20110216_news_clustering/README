Clustering with news articles

Overview:
    Run K-means on a set of news articles along with Wikipedia pages to see if it helps improve the clustering quality.
    
Note:
    * The number of news articles on each day is significantly different, so I used different number of K to run K-means for each day.

Rationale:
    The news articles will help clustering by bridging articles over the same event but has a little bit different set of vocabulary.

Deliverables:
    src/news/
        splitnews.py
            split a text file containing many news stories into separate files each containing one news story.

@ Only at a05:
    data/news/2009/
        original news articles
    
    data/news/2009-01-27 ... 2009-10-12
        split news articlces
        
    data/mix/2009-01-27 ... 2009-10-12
        split news articles along with WP articles

Did:
    Split news articles
        ./splitnews.py 2009-1-27.txt ../2009-01-27/
    
    The number of news articles along with WP articles:
        2009-01-27: 1028
        2009-02-10: 1141
        2009-04-19: 295
        2009-05-12: 1051
        2009-10-12: 1293
    
    Run K-means
        cd src/cluster/kmeans/ClusterFiles
        ./run --input /mnt/data/wikitopics/data/mix/2009-01-27 --k 514 > kmeans_0127
        ./run --input /mnt/data/wikitopics/data/mix/2009-02-10 --k 570 > kmeans_0210
        ./run --input /mnt/data/wikitopics/data/mix/2009-04-19 --k 147 > kmeans_0419
        ./run --input /mnt/data/wikitopics/data/mix/2009-05-12 --k 525 > kmeans_0512
        ./run --input /mnt/data/wikitopics/data/mix/2009-10-12 --k 646 > kmeans_1012
        
        Note that it took a little more time to run K-means: K is significantly larger than 50 (the value of K used before.) Maybe time to do dimensionality reduction.
        
        Made a batch script:
            nohup run_news_articles.sh &

        Filter out news articles:
            cd kmeans-news-1; mkdir raw; mv kmeans* raw
            cd raw; for file in *; do grep -v 2009- $file > ../$file; done; cd ..
        
        Evaluate the results:
            cd ../../../src/cluster/eval

    Run K-means with a much smaller value of K.

Anomaly:
    Ricardo_Montalb√°n:
        The original title is "Ricardo_Montalb\xc3\xa1n\n", but the results of K-means include "Ricardo_Montalba\xcc\x81n\n" instead. I think it is the problem of Mac OS X's file system that is using decomposition unicode.
    B^3 score:
        When every data point is in its own cluster, the B^3 precision and recall is not well defined. Perhaps I don't understand B^3 properly?
