Plot
Edward and Alphonse Elric are two alchemist brothers who search for the legendary Philosopher's Stone, a powerful object which would allow them to recover their bodies (which were lost in an attempt to bring their mother back to life through alchemy).
Born in the village of Resembool from the country of  , the two brothers lived there with their parents.
Their father, Hohenheim, left home for unknown reasons and years later, their mother, Trisha Elric, died of a terminal illness leaving the Elric brothers alone.
After their mother's death, Edward becomes determined to bring her back through the use of alchemy, an advanced science in which objects can be created from raw materials.
They researched Human Transmutation, a forbidden art in which one attempts to create or modify a human being.
However, this attempt failed, ultimately resulting in the loss of Edward's left leg and Alphonse's entire body.
In a desperate effort to save his brother, Edward sacrificed his right arm to affix Alphonse's soul to a suit of armor.
Some days later, an alchemist named Roy Mustang visits the Elric brothers, and he tells Edward to become a member of the State Military of the country to find a way to recover their bodies.
After that, Edward's left leg and right arm are fitted with two sets of automail, a type of advanced prosthetic limb, created for him by his close family friends Winry Rockbell and her grandmother Pinako.
Edward sets out to become a  , an alchemist employed by the State Military of Amestris, which infamously annihilated much of the neighboring country of Ishbal's population in the past decade.
Becoming a State Alchemist enables Edward to use the extensive resources available to State Alchemists, but it also turns him into what they call a "dog of the military".
His more friendly relationship with Roy Mustang however, whom he reports to and who recruited him, allows the brothers freedom to search for the Philosopher's Stone as part of Edward's research, as each State Alchemist is expected to independently research new things which may be of a use to the State Military of Amestris.
The brothers set off in search of the Philosopher's Stone as a means to restore their bodies.
Throughout their journey, they meet many antagonists, including those who are willing to do anything to obtain the Philosopher's Stone; Scar, one of the few surviving Ishbalans, who seeks vengeance on the State Alchemists for the destruction of his race; and the homunculi, a group of human-like creatures who carry pieces of the Philosopher's Stone inside themselves, and from it derive the ability to survive almost any harm.
As the story progresses, Edward and Alphonse discover the vast expansion of Amestris was the result of the homunculi, who created and secretly control the State Military.
The homunculi and much of the high-ranking military officers are commanded from behind the curtains by the creator of the homunculi, a man simply known as Father, who gained immortality by using a copy of Hohenheim as his new body centuries before the series' timeline.
He plans to use Amestris as a gigantic transmutation circle and turn the entire country into a Philosopher's Stone.
When Edward and Alphonse discover Father's plans, they set out to defeat him along with other members of the State Military.
Differences in the first anime adaptation
The first half of the first anime's plot closely follows that of the manga, but diverges near the middle of the story; when the homunculus Greed has his underlings kidnap Alphonse.
A former lover of Hohenheim, Dante, acts as the series' main antagonist, appearing only in the anime.
Centuries ago, the two perfected methods for making the Philosopher's Stone, achieving a sort of immortality by transferring their soul and intellect into others' bodies as they age.
Hohenheim was eventually overcome by the guilt of sacrificing lives to make the Stone and left Dante.
Although Dante is still able to jump from body to body to cheat death over the centuries, she is able to spend less time in each body as it decays faster with each jump.
She uses the Homunculi to spur Edward and Alphonse, along with other Alchemists equally desperate, into creating another complete Philosopher's Stone for her.
When Scar tries to create the Philosopher's Stone, the stone is infused into Alphonse's metal body, making him the main focus of Dante's efforts leading to him being kidnapped.
When Edward goes to rescue him, he is killed by the homunculus Envy.
Alphonse uses the Philosopher's Stone to revive his brother but disappears in the process.
Dante tries to escape but she is killed when the homunculus Gluttony loses control after having his mind destroyed by her.
After being revived, Edward risks his life to bring back his brother in exchange.
As a result, Edward ends up in a parallel world, while Alphonse recovers his original body.
Determined to return with Alphonse, Edward becomes involved in rocketry research, with the intention to use that technology to try to get back to his home world.
The story is followed in Fullmetal Alchemist the Movie: Conqueror of Shamballa situated two years after the end of the anime.
While Edward is working in Germany to find a way to return to Amestris, Dietline Eckhart, a member from the Thule Society, discovers the existence of Ed's world and starts giving him hints to open a portal to Amestris.
Alphonse, having been looking for his brother after two years, also discovers the portal and opens it at the same time as his father Hohenheim opens the one from Germany, allowing Dietline to enter Amestris and try to conquer it.
Edward reunites with his brother and they join forces to defeat Dietline.
Knowing the danger that both worlds are now connected through the portal, Edward returns to Germany to destroy it, knowing that he would be trapped there forever.
Alphonse secretly follows him, having decided to stay with Edward.
Production
After reading about the Philosopher's stone, the author Arakawa said that she became attracted to the idea of using alchemy in the manga.
She liked it so much that she started reading books relating to alchemy, which she found very complicated due to the fact that some books contradicted others.
Arakawa was attracted more by the philosophical aspects than the practical aspects.
For the Equivalent Exchange concept, she was inspired by the work of her parents who had a farm in Hokkaidō and always had to give all their effort in order to earn the money to eat.
Arakawa wanted to integrate social problems into the story.
She gathered information watching news programs and talking to people, such as refugees, war veterans and former yakuza.
Several plot elements expand on these themes, such as Pinako Rockbell caring for the Elric brothers after the death of their mother, and the brothers helping people all over the country, to gain an understanding of the meaning of family.
When creating the fictional world of Fullmetal Alchemist, Arakawa was inspired after reading about Europe during the Industrial Revolution period; she was amazed by how different the people from different countries were, in terms of their culture, architecture and clothes.
She was especially interested in England during this period and "added to it her own original flavor to turn it into a fantasy world".
When the manga began serialization, Arakawa had in mind how the story would end.
As the plot continued, however, she felt some characters were maturing and decided to change some scenes, resulting in some sketches of the faces of the characters being improvised.
In creating the characters' designs, she comments that the manga authors Suihō Tagawa and Hiroyuki Eto are her main inspirations, and describes her artwork is a mix of both of them.
The easiest of the series characters for her to draw was Alex Louis Armstrong, as well as little animals.
Due to the fact she likes dogs, Arakawa added several of them in the story.
Arakawa made comedy central in the manga because she thinks it is intended for entertainment, and tried to minimalize focus on sad scenes.
During the development of the anime, Arakawa allowed the anime staff to work independently from her, and requested having a different ending from the one in the manga.
She said that she would not like to repeat the same ending in both media, as well as to make the manga longer to work more in the development of the characters.
When watching the ending of the anime, she was amazed about how different the homunculi creatures were from the manga and enjoyed how the staff speculated about the origins of the villains.

The developers looked at other titles for inspiration, particularly Square's action role-playing game Kingdom Hearts, in addition to other games based on manga series, such as Dragon Ball, Naruto or One Piece games.
