Stargate Universe is a Canadian-American military science fiction television series created by Brad Wright and Robert C. Cooper as a spin off from its sister shows, Stargate SG-1 and Stargate Atlantis.
The show will have stand-alone episodes and multi-parters, but will have more season-long plot and character threads running through every episode than the other Stargate series.
Brad Wright is hopeful that the show will last three or more seasons.
Season 1 (2009â€“2010)
The first season is planned to consist of 20 episodes.
Brad Wright and Robert C. Cooper wrote the three-parter series opener named "Air", which was originally planned to be a two-parter.
The first two parts of "Air" premiered on Syfy on October 2, 2009, with regularly weekly airing beginning on October 9, 2009.
"Fire" was originally going to be the title for episode four, but the story and script was too big to be able to fit into one episode, so the producers changed it to become a two-parter called "Darkness" and "Light", therefore pushing all future episodes forward one slot.
The back half of the first season is set to air during the second quarter of 2010.
British channel Sky1 acquired the exclusive free and basic pay UK rights to Stargate Universe and will begin airing the series from October 6, 2009.
The series will air on SPACE in Canada.
Thirty webisodes will also be released to tie in to the series, which will center on the Kino (described by Mallozzi as an Ancient version of the MALP) following around the crew of the Destiny.
