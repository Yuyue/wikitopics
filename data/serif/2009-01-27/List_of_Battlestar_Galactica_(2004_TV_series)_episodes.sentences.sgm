The reimagined Battlestar Galactica was initially unveiled as a science fiction miniseries which was first broadcast on the Sci Fi Channel on December 8, 2003.
It spawned a regular television series which premiered on Sky One in the UK & Ireland on October 18, 2004 and on Sci Fi Channel in the U.S. on January 14, 2005.
The miniseries and the first three seasons have been released on DVD in both the U.S. and UK.
The miniseries and episodes are also available for download in the United States through online services such as the iTunes Store and Xbox Live.
This is a complete list of episodes for the reimagined Battlestar Galactica television series, in chronological order.
All titles are provided by the studio, although these titles are not mentioned on screen in the episodes themselves.
Throughout the series, President Laura Roslin has kept the refugee fleet's official survivor count written prominently on a small whiteboard in her office; the count was incorporated into the show's title sequence in the second season.
The number is updated after every episode as soldiers and civilians die, refugees are discovered, and children born, with or without audience's witness.
This count was not included in the first four episodes of the third season, but resumed with the episode "Collaborators".
List of Battlestar Galactica seasons
[a] Razor, though being a television movie, is considered to be the first two episodes of season 4, hence the fourth season is technically 22 episodes and runs from 2007 to 2009.
Miniseries
Battlestar Galactica was a three hour long miniseries which acted as the backdoor pilot for the subsequent 2004 television series.
The pilot was written by Ronald D. Moore who reinvented or, as Moore describes it, "reimagined" the concepts which drove the original 1978 series.
It premiered in the US over two nights (December 3 and 4, 2003) and received critical acclaim and, at the time, was the most-watched program to ever air on the US Sci Fi Channel.
Season 1
Season 2
Webisodes: The Resistance
A series of ten short webisodes released online semi-weekly as promotional material in advance of season 3.
Each of the webisodes chronicle some of the missing timeline between the end of season 2 and beginning of season 3.
The original title of this series was to be Battlestar Galactica: Crossroads ("Crossroads" was later used as the title of the third-season finale).
Season 3
Webisodes: Razor Flashbacks
In 2007, starting in October and concluding in mid-November, SciFi Channel released a series of seven short "webisodes" (termed "featurettes" in their credits) called the Razor Flashbacks (the URL for each file suggests that either the real title or internal name may be Takeover), featuring a young Lt. William Adama (played by Nico Cortez) and original-series-style Cylons and Vipers near the end of the First Cylon War.
The bulk of the vignette takes place in Adama's fighter pilot days, though it concludes with a scene from the first episode of the miniseries and series, in which Commander Adama is reminiscing before the Galactica's soon-to-be-aborted decommissioning ceremony.
The webisodes were written by Michael Taylor and directed by Wayne Rose for the first two episodes and by Félix Alcalá for the last five.
They were first made available directly from the official series homepage at  SciFi.com/battlestar and were later included on the Razor DVD.
These webisodes are somewhat independent and are not simply excerpted from Razor, although Razor integrates approximately half of the webisode material directly.
The webisodes are also available as free downloads on the Xbox Live Marketplace, some of which are featured in high-definition 720p resolution.
Season 4
Season 4 will be the final season of Battlestar Galactica.
According to SciFi Wire, the SciFi Channel ordered 22 episodes to be made for season four, an increase from 13 as originally announced.
The production of the season 4 initially began May 2007.
A special TV movie (or "extended episode") premiered November 24, 2007 which was promptly released soon after on DVD.
The rest of the season began April 4, 2008 but because of the WGA strike, it was postponed but is set to continue January, 2009.
Season 4 episodes were added (and in some cases re-added) to iTunes in SD and HD format, along with the miniseries and all the other Seasons on September 9, 2008.
Razor (TV movie)
Razor was the first television film based on the 2003 reimagining of the Battlestar Galactica franchise.
The movie was made as the first two episodes of the 22 in the production order of Season 4, but was broadcast and released separately from the following episodes November 24, 2007 (6 months before the following episodes).
Razor doesn't directly carry on from the events at the end of season three but follows several narrative threads set earlier in the series; the main framing story is set sometime just before "Lay Down Your Burdens", but most of the film details the sparsely known history of the Pegasus from just prior to the Cylon attack up until Admiral Cain's demise.
Razor was also intended to act as a backdrop for season four by seeding subtle insights of events yet to occur despite its apparent discontinuity between the preceding and successive seasons.
Episodes 3 to 12
Only the first 12 episodes of season four (including Razor which technically takes the first two of 22 episodes order for season 4) were filmed before the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike halted production of all scripted TV shows.
For the 10 regular episodes, Battlestar Galactica averaged a 1.7 Nielsen household rating, 2.2 million total viewers, 1.6 million viewers in the 25-to-54-year-old demographic, and 1.5 million viewers in the coveted 18-to-49-year-old demographic.
This represented an increase of 13 percent in household rating, 11 percent in total viewers, 14 percent in viewers aged 25-to-54, and 6 percent in viewers aged 18-to-49 over the same set of episodes in Season 3.
It was the best showing for the series in the 25-to-54 and 18-to-49 demographics since the first half of Season 2 (July to September 2005).
Season 4 also saw an increase in female viewers.
The series saw an increase of 23 percent in female viewers aged 18-to-49 and an increase of 25 percent in female viewers aged 25-to-54 versus the last 10 episodes of Season 3; the top four episodes of Battlestar Galactica in terms of female viewership all aired in Season 4.
Webisodes: The Face of the Enemy
To bridge the gap between episodes 412 and 413, a third set of webisodes similar in purpose to The Resistance, which aired between Season 2 and 3, was aired.
The set of 10 webisodes was entitled The Face of the Enemy, and was released two times a week leading up to the second half of the season, beginning on December 12, 2008.
The series was directed by Wayne Rose and written by Jane Espenson and Seamus Kevin Fahey.
Episodes 13 to 22
As the second half of Season 4 was halted from production due to the writers' strike in America, the final 10 episodes have been pushed back to January 16, 2009.
The final episode will air on March 20, 2009.
This half-season is advertised as "Battlestar Galactica: The Final Episodes" by SciFi network.
Moore has stated that the final episodes of the series are going to vary in size with the final three possibly constituting a series finale up to 4 hours in length.
The Plan (TV movie)
On August 7, 2008 it was announced by the Sci-Fi channel that a two-hour television movie will air sometime after the series finale.
So far, the confirmed cast include Michael Trucco,  Aaron Douglas and Dean Stockwell as well as the series star Edward James Olmos (who will also be the movie's director).
The plot of The Plan is set after the events of the Cylons' attack on the 12 colonies .
It began production September 8, 2008.
The Plan is likely the final Battlestar Galactica television movie; most of the sets have been struck and many of the props will be sold at auction in January 2009.
DVD releases
*In the title of this box set it does not say that it has the mini-series and this box set does not contain the second half of season 4 but rather episodes 1-12 (including Razor)
The miniseries was released in the UK on March 1, 2004 and in the U.S. and Canada on December 28, 2004, and included deleted scenes, audio commentary, and a behind-the-scenes documentary.
The first season was released to DVD on March 28, 2005 and September 20, 2005 in the UK and North America respectively and included deleted scenes.
The American set also included featurettes, and a tongue-in-cheek promotional special filmed for the Sci Fi Channel in addition to the miniseries.
The second season was released in its entirety in a single volume in the UK, New Zealand, and Australia, but issued in two separate volumes (dubbed "Season 2.0" and "Season 2.5") in the U.S. to correspond with the mid-season break in the broadcast schedule.
Each U.S. volume contains half of the season, along with deleted scenes and podcasts that were previously available on the official website.
"Season 2.5" also contains an extended version of "Pegasus", the last episode of the first half of the season.
The Region 2 DVDs include the extended version of "Pegasus", as well as the commentaries and deleted scenes from the U.S. 2.0 release, but do not contain any of the commentaries and deleted scenes from the 2.5 release (other than the extended Pegasus episode), nor the original, shorter version of "Pegasus" included on the U.S. 2.0 release.
The Canadian DVD release of Season 2.0 was delayed until April 25, 2006, as the episodes had only begun airing in January 2006.
The third season came out in R2 on September 3, 2007 and in R4 on November 21, 2007.
R1 was set for a March 25, 2008 release date.
The R2 & R4 DVDs do not contain any extras but R2's box set came with a 45 minute recap of the previous two seasons (consisting of clips of the seasons strung together with a voice-over).
The fourth season, like season two, will be released in two parts.
In regions 1, 2 and 4 the television movie Razor will be included in "Part 1" as it is technically a part of the season despite it being released separately at an earlier date.
In region 1, however, the extended and shortened versions of Razor will both be included in the "4.0" box set.
In Australia (Region 4) a distribution delay caused by Australia Post resulted in the widespread pushing back of the release date for season four: part 1 (December 3, 2008).
Consequently, many retailers received their stock several days overdue on December 8 or later.
HD DVD release
On August 14, 2007, Universal Studios Home Entertainment announced that the mini-series and Season One would be released on December 4, 2007, in the North American market, on the now-defunct high definition disc format HD DVD.
The technical specifications include 1080p/VC-1 transfers of the mini-series and each episode is in 16:9 widescreen aspect ratio, plus Dolby TrueHD 5.1 surround sound and Dolby Digital-Plus 5.1 surround audio options.
Online availability
In January 2006, Apple began offering the miniseries, season 1 and season 2 episodes for purchase on the U.S. version of its iTunes Store.
After a delay, season 3 episodes were also made available.
NBC Universal, the producer and owner of the show, has provided a number of its shows for purchase the day after broadcast to U.S. customers.
In early December 2007 all of the iTunes Battlestar Galactica episodes were removed along with other NBC-Universal content.
Shortly after being removed from the iTunes service, Amazon's online Video on Demand store started making them available for sale.
All season 1-4 episodes as well as the miniseries and the TV movie Razor are available for purchase in high-quality Windows Media Format.
Since May 2008, the newest episodes are added to Scifi.com Rewind and NBC's Hulu sites eight days after the original air date.
As of May 6, Battlestar Galactica can be downloaded through the Zune marketplace.
All four seasons as well as the mini-series are currently available in both HD and SD format for purchase through the Xbox Live Marketplace for playback via Xbox 360 game consoles.
On September 9, 2008, all episodes so far including the miniseries were released on iTunes, being released in both Standard and  HD format.
