# This is the comparison for coreference resolution.
# The local directory was data/sent/auto-recent.
# 

Each directory has different data set.

auto-first:
	The sentences selected by the First scheme.
auto-recent:
	The sentence selected by the Recent scheme.
auto-recent2:
	Same as above except that is probably the one that went through
	personal pronoun substitution phase.
auto-self:
	The sentence selected by the Self scheme.
auto-self2:
	Same as above except that if there is no sentence under the same criteria
	used in the above one, it falls back on the sentence by the Recent scheme.
ben:
	The manual sentence selection done by Ben.
bahn:
	The manual sentence selection done by me. Only the data for the first day are available.
manual:
	This is actually misnamed. This is the original articles on which the manual 
	sentence selection is based on.
	The data in data/articles/ are re-extracted using the revised Wikipydia module,
	resulting in more text with less errors, but the text extraction was done after
	the revision of the Wikipydia module.
	You need this set of original articles to perform sentence selection evaluation 
	because you need to identify which sentence you chose as best in the original 
	articles.
