Biography
Early life
Quinto, who is of half-Italian and half-Irish descent, was born in Pittsburgh and grew up in nearby Green Tree, Pennsylvania, with his mother Margo, and brother Joe.
His father, John, who was a barber, died of cancer when Quinto was 7 years old.
He graduated from Central Catholic High School in 1995 and then attended Carnegie Mellon University's School of Drama, from which he graduated in 1999.
Career
Quinto first appeared on television in the short-lived television series The Others, and appeared as a guest star on shows including CSI, Touched By An Angel, Charmed, Six Feet Under, Lizzie McGuire, and L.A.
Dragnet.
In 2003, he landed a recurring role on the Fox series 24, as computer expert Adam Kaufman.
Quinto appeared in all but one of the third season episodes of 24.
In 2006, Quinto played the role of Sasan, the haughty, Persian-American best friend of Tori Spelling on her VH1 series  So NoTORIous.
Later that year, he joined the cast of NBC's Heroes as the quiet, insecure, and dangerously superpowered serial killer Syler.
Quinto had expressed interest in portraying Spock in a 2006 article in which he noted his resemblance to Leonard Nimoy.
On July 23, 2007, several websites including E!
Online reported that Quinto had in fact been cast as Spock.
An official announcement confirming this followed on July 26, 2007, at the 2007 Comic-Con.
Speaking alongside Leonard Nimoy at a press conference to promote the new Star Trek film, Quinto revealed that Nimoy had been given casting approval over who would play the role of the young Spock".For me Leonard's involvement was only liberating, frankly," says Quinto.
"I knew that he had approval over the actor that would play young Spock, so when I got the role I knew from the beginning it was with his blessing".
In a September 2008 interview, Star Trek director J.J. Abrams said of Quinto's performance as Spock: "Zachary brought a gravity and an incredible sense of humor, which is a wonderful combination because Spock's character is deceivingly complicated.
The revelation for me watching the movie, when I finally got to watch the whole thing after working on sequences, was that he is extraordinary.
He was doing things I didn't even realize while we were shooting - these amazing things to track his story".
Following Star Trek, he appeared in the comedy short "Boutonniere" (2009), explaining it  "...was a movie written and directed by my former landlady and friend [actress Coley Sohn].
She called up and said, 'Would you do me a favor and be in my short film?
' I played this very brief but extreme, funny character.... [I]t's had a fair amount of success on the festival circuit".
Quinto made an appearance on Saturday Night Live on the May 9, 2009, episode, hosted by Justin Timberlake.
He was featured on "Weekend Update" with Chris Pine and Leonard Nimoy.
