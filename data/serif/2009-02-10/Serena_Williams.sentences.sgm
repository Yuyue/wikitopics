Serena Jameka Williams (born September 26, 1981) is an American professional tennis player who, as of February 2, 2009, is ranked World No.
1 by the Women's Tennis Association, having now held that ranking on four different occasions.
She is the current US Open and Australian Open singles champion and has won 20 Grand Slam titles: ten in singles, eight in women's doubles, and two in mixed doubles.
She also has won two Olympic gold medals in women's doubles.
She is the most recent player, male or female, to have held all four Grand Slam singles titles simultaneously.
Williams has won more career prize money than any other woman, in any sport.
In 2005, Tennis magazine ranked her as the 17th-best player of the preceding forty years.
She is the younger sister of a former World No.
1 professional female tennis player, Venus Williams.
Playing style
Williams is primarily a baseline player.
Her game is built around taking immediate control of rallies with her powerful and consistent serve, return of serve, and forceful groundstrokes that can come from both the forehand and backhand wing.
Her serve is widely regarded as the best in the women's game.
She is known for having a very smooth motion and her serve is one of the most highly respected on the WTA tour.
For example, Lindsay Davenport has said that Williams's serve is the best serve that she has faced on the WTA tour.
Williams frequently hits serves over 120 mph and often varies the placement of her serve; in 2006 at Cincinnati she struck a serve which measured at 127 mph and in 2008 at Charleston she recorded 129 mph, a speed which only two other female players have exceeded.
She can hit flat, slice, and topspin serves to both corners of the service box.
Williams is capable of overpowering her opponents when returning serve, off both second and first serve.
Williams is also effective at the net, employing solid volleys (being especially effective on the drive volley) and powerful overheads.
She also can produce good drop volleys, a shot that not many players use.
Although Williams's forehand is among the most powerful shots in the women's game, her backhand is considered to be one of the best, if not the best, on the Women's Tennis Association tour.
Williams can often hit a winning backhand shot in any position or place on the court down the line or cross court albeit on the defence or under pressure.
Williams strikes her backhand groundstroke using an open stance.
She also uses the same open stance for her forehand.
Because of her aggressive style of play, Williams hits a relatively high number of unforced errors.
This is tempered, however, by the fact that she typically hits more outright winners than her opponents.
Other times her number of unforced errors are tempered by her powerful strokes forcing her opponents to commit errors.
Although many think of Williams as only an offensive player, she also has a good defensive game.
Williams is quick around the court, and her core strength enables her to hit the ball efficiently from difficult positions.
Williams has more variety in her game than the typical offensive baseline player.
Although she normally dictates play from the baseline with heavy strokes, Williams occasionally slices her backhand or hits heavy topspin groundstrokes or drop shots to change the pace of the ball.
Career
Early years
Serena was born in Saginaw, Michigan into an African American family.
When she, her sister, and her three half sisters were young, their parents, Richard and Oracene (also called Brandy), moved to the Los Angeles suburb of Compton.
Her father dreamed of making at least one of his daughters a tennis superstar, hoping that involvement in sports would give them an opportunity for a better life.
The children were homeschooled.
When Serena was four and a half, she won her first tournament, and she entered 49 tournaments by the age of 10, winning 46 of them.
At one point, she replaced her sister Venus as the number one ranked tennis player aged 12 or under in California.
In 1991, Richard Williams, saying that he hoped to prevent his daughters from facing racism, stopped sending them to national junior tennis tournaments, and Serena attended a tennis school run by professional player Rick Macci in Haines City, Florida at Greneleaf Resort and Conference Center instead.
Macci had already helped the careers of Jennifer Capriati and Mary Pierce, among others.
During that time period, Serena would sometimes train with Andy Roddick.
Both players recall that Serena beat him in a practice match, although the two dispute the score, with Serena saying it was 6–1 and Roddick claiming it was 6–4.
Soon Richard, who had struck a deal on behalf of his daughters with a major clothing company, was able to move the rest of the Williams family to West Palm Beach, to be near Serena and Venus.
1995–1998
Williams became a professional in September 1995 at the age of 14.
Because of her age, she had to participate in non-WTA events at first.

Williams explains how her deceased older sister Yetunde inspired her to win her third Australian Open singles title in 2007: "I just said, 'Serena, this has to be motivating.
This has to be more than enough to motivate me,' and I think it was".
At the 1999 US Open, Williams said about Martina Hingis, "She just speaks her mind.
I guess it has a little bit to do with not having a formal education.
But you just have to think more ... use your brain a little more in the tennis world".
