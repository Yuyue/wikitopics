David "Dave" Lance Arneson (October 1, 1947 – April 7, 2009) was an American game designer who popularized role-playing games (RPGs) using devices now considered to be archetypical, such as adventuring in "dungeons", and co-created the first published game in this genre, Dungeons & Dragons (D&D), with Gary Gygax in the early 1970s.
