Brett Lorenzo Favre ( ) (born October 10, 1969, in  ) is an American football quarterback for the Minnesota Vikings.
He was the starting quarterback for the Green Bay Packers between 1992 and 2007, and for the New York Jets in 2008.
Favre started at the quarterback position for the University of Southern Mississippi for four years before being selected in the second round of the 1991 NFL Draft by the Atlanta Falcons (33rd overall).
After one season with the Falcons, Favre was traded to the Green Bay Packers on February 10, 1992, for the 19th pick in the 1992 NFL Draft.
He became the Packers' starting quarterback in the fourth game of the 1992 season, starting every game from then until his retirement in 2008.
In 2008, Favre came out of retirement, was traded to the New York Jets, and continued his consecutive start streak.
On February 11, 2009, Favre told the New York Jets that he was again retiring.
He came out of retirement for the second time and signed with the Minnesota Vikings on August 18, 2009.
When Favre un-retired for the second time, some in the sports world claimed his legacy as a football player has become overshadowed by his need for attention.
Favre is statistically the greatest quarterback of all time.
Favre is the only player to win the AP Most Valuable Player three consecutive times (1995–97).
He led the Packers to seven division championships (1995, 1996, 1997, 2002, 2003, 2004, and 2007), four NFC Championship Games (1995, 1996, 1997, and 2007), winning two (1996 and 1997), and two Super Bowl appearances, winning one (Super Bowl XXXI).
He holds many NFL records including: most career touchdown passes (473), most career passing yards (65,964), most career pass completions (5,805), most career pass attempts (9,405), most career interceptions thrown (311), most consecutive starts (274), and most career victories as a starting quarterback (173).
Early years
Favre was born in Gulfport, Mississippi, and raised in the small town of Kiln.
He is of French and Choctaw ancestry; one of his paternal grandparents was a Native American affiliated with the Choctaw.
He was the second of four children and attended Hancock North Central High School where he played baseball and football.
Favre started for the Hancock North Central baseball team as an eighth–grader and earned five varsity letters.
He played quarterback, lineman, strong safety, placekicker and punter in a primarily option, run-oriented offense coached by his father, Irvin Favre.
Irvin Favre said he knew his son had a great arm but also knew that the school was blessed with good running backs.
As a result, in the three years Brett was on the team, his father ran a run-oriented offense called the wishbone.
Favre rarely threw more than five passes in a game.
College career
After high school Southern Mississippi offered Favre a scholarship (the only one he received).
Southern Miss wanted him to play defensive back but Favre wanted to play quarterback instead.
Favre began his freshman year as the seventh–string quarterback and took over the starting position in the second half of the third game of the year against Tulane on September 19, 1987.
Favre, despite suffering a hangover from the night before and vomiting during warm-ups, led the Golden Eagles to a come-from-behind victory with two touchdown passes.
In his junior season, Favre led the Golden Eagles to an upset of Florida State (then ranked sixth in the nation) on September 2, 1989.
Favre capped a six-and-a-half-minute drive with the game–winning touchdown pass with 23 seconds remaining.
On July 14, 1990, before the start of Favre's senior year at Southern Miss, he was involved in a near-fatal car accident.
When going around a bend a few tenths of a mile from his parents' house, Favre lost control of his car, which flipped three times and came to rest against a tree.
It was only after one of his brothers smashed a car window with a golf club that Favre could be evacuated to the hospital.
In the ambulance, his mother was sitting with him.
"All I kept asking [her] was 'Will I be able to play football again?
'" Favre recalled later.
Doctors would later remove   of Favre's small intestine.
Six weeks after this incident, on September 8, Favre led Southern Miss to a comeback victory over Alabama.
Alabama coach Gene Stallings said, "You can call it a miracle or a legend or whatever you want to.
I just know that on that day, Brett Favre was larger than life".
Favre continues to hold various Southern Miss football records.
As of the end of the 2007 season, he holds the career individual record in the following categories: most plays, most total yards gained, most passing yards gained, most completions made, and most passing attempts made.
He had held the record for the most touchdowns scored (52), but it was later tied by quarterback Lee Roberts, who played for the school from 1995–98.
Favre had 15 games over his career where he compiled more than 200 passing yards, making him the fourth all–time school leader in that category.
Of those 15 games, 5 were 300–yard games, the most compiled by any of the school's quarterbacks.
Additionally, he was the seasonal leader in total passing and total offense in all four of his seasons at Southern Miss.
Favre earned a teaching degree with an emphasis in special education from the University of Southern Mississippi.
Professional career
Atlanta Falcons (1991)
Favre was drafted by the Atlanta Falcons in the second round, 33rd overall in the 1991 NFL Draft.
On July 19, 1991, Favre agreed to a three-year, $1.4 million contract with a reported signing bonus of $350,000.
Atlanta coach Jerry Glanville did not approve of the drafting of Favre, saying it would take a plane crash for him to put Favre into the game.
Favre's first pass in an NFL regular season game resulted in an interception returned for a touchdown.
He only attempted four passes in his career at Atlanta, was intercepted twice, and completed none of them.
The Green Bay Packers general manager Ron Wolf traded a first–round pick (19th overall, RB Tony Smith, Southern Miss) for Favre during the following offseason.
Wolf, while an assistant to the general manager of the New York Jets, had intended to take Favre in the 1991 NFL draft, but Favre was taken by the Falcons on the previous pick.
According to the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel and other sources, during the physical after the trade, Favre was diagnosed with avascular necrosis, the same degenerative hip condition that ended Bo Jackson's career, and doctors recommended his physical be failed, which would nullify the trade.
Wolf overruled them.
Green Bay Packers (1992–2007)
Brett Favre played 16 seasons in Green Bay.
During his time in Green Bay, Favre was the first NFL player to win three AP MVP awards, a feat matched only once since.
He helped the Packers appear in two Super Bowls, winning Super Bowl XXXI.
Favre also started every Green Bay Packers game from September 20, 1992, to January 20, 2008.
Beginnings (1992–1994)
In the second game of the 1992 season, the Packers played the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
The Buccaneers were leading 17–0 at halftime when head coach Mike Holmgren benched starting quarterback Don Majkowski and Favre played the second half.
On his first regular season play as a Packer, Favre threw a pass that was deflected and caught by himself.
Favre was tackled and the completion went for -7 yards.
The Packers lost the game 31–3, chalking up only 106 yards passing.
In the third game of the 1992 season, Majkowski injured a ligament in his ankle against the Cincinnati Bengals, an injury severe enough that he would be out for four weeks.
Favre replaced Majkowski for the remainder of the contest.
Favre fumbled four times during the course of the game, a performance poor enough that the crowd chanted for Favre to be removed in favor of another Packers backup quarterback at the time, Ty Detmer.
However, down 23–17 with 1:07 left in the game, the Packers started an offensive series on their own 8 yard line.
Still at the quarterback position, Favre completed a 42 yard pass to Sterling Sharpe.
Three plays later, Favre threw the game–winning touchdown pass to Kitrick Taylor with 13 seconds remaining.
The next week's game against the Pittsburgh Steelers began the longest consecutive starts streak for a quarterback in NFL history.
The game ended in a 17–3 victory and his passer rating was 144.6.
During the season, Favre helped put together a six-game winning streak for the Packers, the longest winning streak for the club since 1965.
They ended 9–7 that season, missing the playoffs on their last game.
Favre finished his first season as a Packer with 3,227 yards and a quarterback rating of 85.3, helping him to his first Pro Bowl.
The following season Favre helped the Packers to their first playoff berth since 1982 and was named to his second Pro Bowl.
After the season Favre became a free agent.
General manager Ron Wolf negotiated Favre into a five-year, $19 million contract.
The Packers finished the 1994 season 9–7, advancing them to the playoffs in back to back years, a feat they had not accomplished since the Vince Lombardi era.
MVPs and Super Bowl seasons (1995–1997)
In 1995, Favre won the first of his three AP MVP awards.
Favre led the Packers to an 11–5 record, Green Bay's best record in nearly thirty years.
Favre passed for a career high of 4,413 yards, 38 touchdowns, and recorded a quarterback rating of 99.5, the highest of his career.
The Packers advanced to the NFC Championship Game after upsetting the San Francisco 49ers in the NFC Divisional Game.
The Packers lost the NFC Championship game to the Dallas Cowboys, marking the third year in a row the Packers season was ended by the Cowboys in the playoffs.
Favre helped the Packers advance farther in the playoffs than any other Packer team since 1967, the season the Packers won Super Bowl II.
While being treated for various injuries, Brett Favre developed an addiction to vicodin, which became publicly known when he suffered a seizure during a hospital visit.
Amid an NFL investigation, he went public to avoid any rumors about his condition.
In May 1996, he went into treatment and remained in rehabilitation for 46 days.
Had he chosen not to go, the NFL would have imposed a $900,000 fine.
Favre led the Packers to their best season in 30 years in the 1996 season, winning his second consecutive MVP award in the process.
The Packers led the NFL in points scored as well as fewest points scored against.
Green Bay tied the Denver Broncos for the NFL's best regular season record, 13–3, defeated the San Francisco 49ers and Carolina Panthers at Lambeau Field in the playoffs.
The Packers advanced to Super Bowl XXXI at the Louisiana Superdome, a short drive from Favre's hometown.
In Super Bowl XXXI, Favre completed 14 of 27 passes for 246 yards and 2 touchdowns.
On the second play of the game, Favre threw a 54–yard touchdown pass to receiver Andre Rison.
Favre also completed an 81–yard touchdown pass to Antonio Freeman in the second quarter (then a Super Bowl record).
Favre rushed for 12 yards and another touchdown, as the Packers won Super Bowl XXXI over the New England Patriots, 35–21.
In their 19 games of the season, the Packers had a turnover ratio of plus 24, and outscored their opponents 100–48 in the playoffs.
Favre and the Packers continued their dominance of the NFC during the next season.
Favre was named AP co-MVP of the league along with Detroit Lions' running back Barry Sanders, his third straight award.
Also, Green Bay advanced to the Super Bowl for the second year in a row.
After being heavily favored, the Packers lost to the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl XXXII by the score of 31-24 at Qualcomm Stadium in San Diego.
Favre completed 25 of 42 passes for 256 yards and 3 touchdowns, with 1 interception in the losing effort.
1998–2003
Favre and the Packers continued posting positive results through the next few seasons.
Through the 2004 season, the Packers had the longest streak of non-losing seasons (13) in the NFL, despite an 8–8 record under coach Ray Rhodes, a 9–7 season under coach Mike Sherman, and no playoff berths in either 1999 or 2000.
The streak ended in 2005, with the Packers finishing 4–12 overall.
Favre and the Packers have not had much success in the postseason prior to the Packers' appearance in the 2007 NFC Championship Game versus the New York Giants; they are 3–5 in the playoffs since the 1998 season.
On March 1, 2001, Favre signed a "lifetime" contract extension, which technically was a 10–year contract extension worth around $100 million dollars.
In the regular season finale of 2001, Favre was the target of minor controversy when, in a game against the New York Giants at Giants Stadium, he was sacked by the Giants defensive end Michael Strahan.
It was Strahan's lone sack of the game and gave him the NFL's single–season sack record of 22.5, which topped Mark Gastineau's record of 22 set in 1984.
Some analysts, such as Mike Freeman of The New York Times, expressed the opinion that Favre allowed himself to be sacked in order to allow Strahan to set the record.
2003 Oakland Raiders game
One day after his father died of a heart attack or stroke, Favre decided to play in a December 22, 2003, Monday Night Football game against the Oakland Raiders.
Favre passed for four touchdowns in the first half and 399 total yards in a 41–7 victory over the Raiders on international television (even receiving applause from "Raider Nation").
Afterwards, Favre said, "I knew that my dad would have wanted me to play.
I love him so much and I love this game.
It's meant a great deal to me, to my dad, to my family, and I didn't expect this kind of performance.
But I know he was watching tonight".
He was named NFC Offensive Player of the Week for his performance.
He then went to his father's funeral in Pass Christian, Mississippi.
Favre won an ESPY Award for his Monday Night Football performance.
2004–2006
A notable game in the 2004 season in which Favre and the Packers finished 10–6 was against the New York Giants.
During the game, Favre suffered a concussion.
He did not receive medical clearance to re-enter the game.
Despite the concussion, Favre threw a 28 yard touchdown to Javon Walker on a fourth down play.
Afterwards it was reported that Favre did not remember throwing the touchdown pass.
After the death of his father, a series of events related to Favre's family were reported in the media.
In October 2004, ten months after the death of Favre's father, his brother-in-law, Casey Tynes, was killed in an all-terrain vehicle accident on Favre's Mississippi property.
Soon after in 2004, Favre's wife, Deanna Favre, was diagnosed with breast cancer.
Following aggressive treatment through 2004, she recovered.
She created The Deanna Favre Hope Foundation which supports breast cancer education and women's breast imaging and diagnosis services for all women, including those who are medically underserved.
In late August 2005, Favre's family suffered another setback: Hurricane Katrina blew through Mississippi, destroying his family's home there; however, none of his family members were injured.
Brett and Deanna's property in Hattiesburg, Mississippi was also extensively damaged by the storm.
Favre elected to continue to play in the 2005 season.
For the 2005 season, the Packers, despite throwing for over 3,000 yards for a record 14th consecutive time, Favre had a below average season with only 20 touchdown passes and a league-leading 29 interceptions.
The loss of guards Marco Rivera and Mike Wahle to free agency along with key injuries to Javon Walker, Ahman Green, Bubba Franks, among others, hampered Favre and the team.
His passer rating was 70.9, 31st in the NFL and the worst single season rating of his career.
After the disappointing season, many speculated that Favre would retire.
However, on April 26, 2006, Favre announced that he would remain with the team for the 2006 season.
Despite earlier comments that the 2006 season would be his last, Favre announced in a press conference on May 6, 2006, that he had not ruled out the possibility of returning beyond the 2006 season.
For the 2006 season, the Packers, Favre suffered his first career shutout against the Chicago Bears.
Later in the season, the New England Patriots shut out the Packers in a game where he was injured before halftime and could not complete the game.
On September 24, 2006, he became just the second quarterback in NFL history to record 400 touchdown passes (Dan Marino being the first).
He connected with rookie wide receiver Greg Jennings on a 5–yard pass that Jennings turned into a 75–yard touchdown play during a win against the Detroit Lions.
He also became the first player ever to complete 5,000 passes in his career.
On December 31, 2006, the Packers played their last game of the season, winning 26–7 against the Chicago Bears.
It was his 22nd career win versus the Bears, moving him to an all-time record of 22–8.
Milestone season (2007)
On February 26, 2007, Brett Favre underwent minor arthroscopic ankle surgery in Green Bay, Wisconsin to remove a buildup of bone spurs in his left ankle.
Favre began the 2007 season trailing in a number of career NFL passing records.
On September 16, 2007, Favre and the Packers defeated the New York Giants to give Favre his record setting 149th win, passing John Elway.
On September 30, Favre threw a 16 yard touchdown pass to Greg Jennings in a game against the Vikings.
This was his 421st NFL touchdown pass, and set a new all time record, surpassing Dan Marino's 420.
On November 4, 2007, after the Packers defeated the Kansas City Chiefs 33–22, Favre became only the 3rd quarterback to have defeated all thirty-one other current NFL teams.
He joined Peyton Manning and Tom Brady as the only quarterbacks in NFL history to do this, just the week after the two of them achieved the accomplishment.
On Thanksgiving 2007, Favre led the Packers to a 37–26 win over the Lions, and brought Packers to a 10–1 record.
He won the Galloping Gobbler award, given by the broadcasters at Fox to the game MVP.
Favre threw three touchdown passes for his 63rd career game with at least three touchdowns, surpassing Marino's former record of 62.
Favre led the Packers to a 13–3 regular season record, the NFC North championship, and the second seed in the NFC playoffs.
Prior to the Packers' playoff game against the Seattle Seahawks, Favre stated his desire to continue playing football for another season.
In the Divisional Playoffs, Favre threw three touchdowns as the Packers cruised to a 42–20 victory over the Seahawks at a snowy Lambeau Field.
The Packers' season ended the following week when they suffered a 23–20 overtime loss in the NFC Championship Game to the eventual Super Bowl Champion New York Giants.
Negotiating sub-zero temperatures, Favre amassed 236 passing yards and two touchdowns, but also threw an interception in overtime that setup the Giants' game-winning field goal.
Favre's 90–yard touchdown pass to Donald Driver in the second quarter was the longest pass in Packers playoff history, and it extended Favre's NFL record for consecutive postseason games with a touchdown pass to 18.
Favre stated after the game that he would make a decision more quickly than he has in the past regarding whether he would return for another season.
Favre's milestone 2007 season culminated with his selection to the 2008 Pro Bowl as the starting quarterback for the NFC, but an ankle injury forced him to withdraw.
Retirement and return (2008)
On March 4, 2008, Favre formally announced his retirement.
Although Favre stated that he had been willing to play another year, he felt that another season would only be successful if he led his team to another Super Bowl victory.
He added the chances for a Super Bowl win are small, and that he wasn't up for the challenge.
At his press conference, Favre openly wept about leaving the NFL.
He stated that his decision, regardless of what was being said in the media, had nothing to do with what the Packers did or didn't do.
He said, seemingly contradictory to Cook's statements, that his decision to retire was based on the fact that he didn't want to play anymore.
He said during the conference, "I know I can play, but I don't think I want to.
And that's really what it comes down to".
On July 2, 2008, it was reported that Favre was in contact with the Packers about a possible return to the team.
On July 11, 2008, Favre sent a letter to the Packers asking for his unconditional release to allow him to play for another NFL team.
Packers general manager Ted Thompson announced he would not grant Favre an unconditional release and reaffirmed the organization's commitment to Aaron Rodgers as its new quarterback.
Complicating matters is Favre's unique contract giving him the leverage to void any potential trade by not reporting to the camp of the team he might be traded to if the Packers elect to go that route.
Favre spoke publicly for the first time about his potential comeback in a July 14, 2008, interview with Greta Van Susteren on the Fox News Channel's On the Record with Greta Van Susteren.
In the interview, Favre said he was "guilty of retiring early," that he was "never fully committed" to retirement, and that he was pressured by the Packers to make a decision before the NFL Draft and the start of the free agent signing period.
Favre disputed the notion that he doesn't want to play for Green Bay and said that while he understands the organization has decided to move on, they should now allow him to do the same.
He made clear that he would not return to the Packers as a backup and reiterated his desire to be released rather than traded, which would allow him the freedom to play for a competitive team.
Favre also accused the Packers of being dishonest, wishing the team would have been straightforward with him and the public.
In the second part of the interview, which aired on July 15, Favre expressed his frustration with Packer management, spoke of his sympathy for successor Aaron Rodgers' predicament, and affirmed he is 100 percent committed to playing football in 2008.
FOXSports.com's Jay Glazer reported on July 16, 2008, that the Packers filed tampering charges against the Minnesota Vikings with the league office, alleging improper communication between Vikings offensive coordinator Darrell Bevell and Favre, although one source suggested that Favre may have been in contact with Vikings head coach Brad Childress.
After an investigation, Commissioner Roger Goodell ruled there had been no violation of tampering rules.
Favre formally filed for reinstatement with the NFL on July 29, 2008, and his petition was granted by Commissioner Goodell, effective August 4, 2008.
Favre then flew to Green Bay to report to Packers training camp.
After a lengthy meeting with head coach Mike McCarthy and general manager Ted Thompson, however, both sides agreed it was time for Favre and the organization to part ways.
McCarthy sensed Favre wasn't in "the right mind-set" to resume playing for the Packers, while Favre felt that his relationship with Packer management had deteriorated to the point that a return to the team would be untenable.
New York Jets (2008)
After negotiations with both the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and New York Jets, the Packers traded Favre to the Jets on August 7, 2008, in exchange for a conditional fourth round pick in the 2009 draft with performance escalation.
Favre's season with the Jets started well; in week four of the 2008 season he threw six touchdowns against the Arizona Cardinals, a personal best and one fewer than the NFL record.
This performance led to him being selected as the FedEx Air Player of the Week.
By week 12 the Jets had compiled an 8-3 record, including a win over the previously undefeated Tennessee Titans.
However, the Jets lost four out of the last five games of the season including the final game against the Miami Dolphins, who had acquired Chad Pennington after he was released from the Jets to make room for Favre.
In those five games Favre threw eight interceptions and only two touchdown passes, bringing his season total to twenty-two of each.
Favre had complained of shoulder pain and had an MRI performed on December 29, 2008, which revealed a torn biceps tendon in his right shoulder.
However, it was stated that Favre would only need an arthroscopic procedure and not major surgery.
Off-season (2009)
After the 2008 season, Favre told Jets general manager Mike Tannenbaum, "it may be time to look in a different direction" regarding the quarterback position.
On February 11, 2009, Favre informed the Jets that he was retiring after 18 seasons.
In May 2009, Favre asked for and was granted a release from the Jets Reserve/Retired list, freeing him to sign with any team.
Amid speculation that Favre would once again attempt a comeback, it was reported that Favre had undergone arthroscopic surgery to complete a tear in his throwing arm.
On June 15, 2009, Favre stated he was considering playing again, most likely with the Minnesota Vikings.
On July 28, Brett Favre informed Vikings officials that he would remain retired.
On the morning of August 18, 2009, WCCO-TV, a CBS affiliate in Minneapolis, Minnesota reported that Favre would sign with the Minnesota Vikings later in the day.
ESPN.com later reported the same news, as Favre would sign a contract with the Vikings pending a physical.
Minnesota Vikings (2009–present)
After months of negotiations, and at one point telling the Vikings he would remain retired, Favre officially signed with the Minnesota Vikings on August 18, 2009.
He was signed to a two-year, $25 million deal.
During Week 2, on September 20, Favre surpassed former Vikings defensive end Jim Marshall for consecutive starts at one position with 271.
On September 27, Brett Favre threw a 32-yard touchdown pass to WR Greg Lewis with 2 seconds remaining to give the Vikings a dramatic come-from-behind 27-24 victory over the San Francisco 49ers.
In that game, Favre's 301 passing yards marked the first 300-yard performance for a Vikings quarterback since September 25, 2005.
On October 5, with a 30-23 victory over the Green Bay Packers, his former team, Favre became the first quarterback in NFL history to defeat every one of the league's 32 franchises.
Monday night’s game between Minnesota and Green Bay was the most-viewed television program, sports or otherwise, in the history of cable television.
The game drew a 15.3 rating and had 21.8 million viewers.

Favre is one of only three quarterbacks to have led a single team (the Packers) to victory over the other thirty-one teams in the league.
The other two are Tom Brady (who accomplished this with the New England Patriots) and Peyton Manning (who did it with the Indianapolis Colts).
Coincidentally, all three achieved this within one week of each other: Manning and Brady accomplished this in Week 8 of the 2007 season, and Favre did it one week later.
In addition, Favre owns a number of team records, having printed his name into almost every passing category in the annals of Green Bay Packers history.
Most recently, he set the team record for consecutive completions with 20 on November 22, 2007, against the Detroit Lions.
Consecutive starts streak
Since first being named the starter of the Green Bay Packers before playing the Pittsburgh Steelers on September 27, 1992, Brett Favre has never missed a game.
He is currently in first place for the most consecutive starts by a quarterback in the NFL and one of only five quarterbacks to have started over 100 consecutive games in NFL history.
He failed to finish a game due to injury on only six occasions since taking control of the Packers as quarterback.
Besides Favre, there is only one other active streak of 100 or more games among quarterbacks, that of Peyton Manning.
Since the beginning of Favre's consecutive start streak, 212 other quarterbacks have started in the NFL, 12 of them being back-ups to Favre at one point.
Among his former backups are: Don Majkowski, Ty Detmer, Kurt Warner, Mark Brunell, Steve Bono, Doug Pederson, Matt Hasselbeck, Danny Wuerffel, Aaron Brooks, J. T. O'Sullivan, and current Packers starter Aaron Rodgers.
Two veteran backups to Favre never started another NFL game: Jim McMahon, and T.J. Rubley.
The consecutive starts streak is widely considered one of the most notable streaks in sports, so much so that the Pro Football Hall of Fame has as an exhibit displaying the jersey Favre wore during his record breaking 117th consecutive start as a quarterback, and a section of their website devoted to what the Hall of Fame calls an "Iron Man".
In 2009, Favre surpassed Jim Marshall for starts at any position with his record-breaking 271st start as a quarterback as the Vikings played the Lions.
Personal life
Favre married Deanna Tynes on July 14, 1996.
Together they have two daughters, Brittany (born 1989) and Breleigh (born 1999).
They are members of the Roman Catholic Church.
His parents, Bonita & Irvin Favre, helped manage his holdings in agriculture and real estate, handled his endorsements and appearances and oversaw his charity work.
Brett and Bonita Favre released a book in 2004 titled Favre (ISBN 978-1590710364) which discusses their personal family and Green Bay Packers family, including the Monday Night Football game that followed the death of Brett's father Irvin Favre.
Favre established the Brett Favre Fourward Foundation in 1996.
In conjunction with his annual golf tournament, celebrity softball game and fundraising dinners, the foundation has donated more than $2 million to charities in his home state of Mississippi as well as to those in his adopted state of Wisconsin.
The Favre family also owns and operates the Brett Favre's Steakhouse, located in Green Bay, Wisconsin.
