The Grammy Awards (originally called the Gramophone Awards)—or Grammys—are presented annually by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States for outstanding achievements in the music industry.
The awards ceremony features performances by prominent artists, and some of the awards of more popular interest are presented in a widely-viewed televised ceremony.
The current President of the Academy is Neil Portnow.
The awards were established in 1958.
Prior to the first live Grammys telecast in 1971 on ABC, a series of taped annual specials in the 1960s called The Best on Record were broadcast on NBC.
The first Grammy Award telecast took place on the night of November 29, 1959, as an episode of the NBC anthology series Sunday Showcase, which was normally devoted to plays, original TV dramas, and variety shows.
Until 1971, awards ceremonies were held in both New York and Los Angeles, with winners accepting at one of the two.
Pierre Cossette bought the rights to broadcast the ceremony from the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences and organized the first live telecast.
CBS bought the rights in 1973 after moving the ceremony to Nashville, Tennessee; the American Music Awards were created for ABC as a result.
The award ceremony is generally held in February.
The 51st Grammy Awards ceremony was held on February 8, 2009, and was held at Los Angeles' Staples Center for the sixth consecutive year.
Gramophone trophy
The actual trophy is manufactured exclusively by  Billings Artworks in Ridgway, Colorado.
The trophies are all hand made and assembled.
Years ago, the old smaller gramophone had to be revamped because the metals were too soft and there were many problems with the trophy breaking.
The trophy was made bigger and grander.
The Grammy is assembled in pieces and finally finished off in gold plating.
The trophies used for the broadcast are called "stunt" Grammys.
As of 2007, 7,578 Grammy trophies have been awarded.
Categories
The "General Field" are four awards which are not restricted by genre.
Record of the Year is awarded to the performer and the production team of a single song.
Album of the Year is awarded to the performer and the production team of a full album.
Song of the Year is awarded to the writer(s)/composer(s) of a single song.
Best New Artist is awarded to a performer who releases, during the Eligibility Year, the first recording which establishes the public identity of that artist (which may not necessarily be their first proper release).
Other awards are given for performance and production in specific genres, as well as for other contributions such as artwork and video.
Special awards are also given out for more long-lasting contributions to the music industry.
Nomination process
The National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences and record companies are responsible for entering into nomination the works that they deem most deserving.
Once a work is entered, reviewing sessions are held by over 150 experts from the recording industry.
This is done only to determine whether or not a work is eligible or entered into the proper category for official nomination.
The nomination process requires that members vote only in their fields of expertise.
They may nominate in the four general categories (Record of the Year, Album of the Year, Song of the Year and Best New Artist) and in no more than nine out of 31 fields on their ballots.
Once the nominations are secured, Recording Academy members may then vote in the four general categories and in no more than eight of the 31 fields.
Ballots are tabulated secretly by the major independent accounting firm Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu.
As of 2006, the eligibility period for the Grammy Awards begins October 1.
Criticism
Certain musical artists have voiced personal issues with the nature of the Grammys.
Singer Maynard James Keenan, of rock band Tool did not attend the Grammys ceremony to receive their award.
He explained his reasons:
The Grammys are often criticized for sucess to represent adequately the sentiments of the public.
Some critics have argued that major award shows like the Grammys are merely the recording industry's attempt to congratulate themselves while advertising their products and ideas through the use of selection bias in the nomination and award process.
Some critics argue that winners naturally reflect "the social, political and artistic preferences of the nominating and voting members".
Other critics within and outside of the industry openly question that music award shows are relevant in today's digital society.
Award shows appear generally to be relevant agents of change in the industry: Billboard Magazine regularly observes a spike in an artist's or group's album sales after winning a Grammy Award.
Such evidence, however, should naturally be considered in light of confirmation bias.
Additionally, many have criticized the Grammys for distributing many more awards than necessary, and that a large portion of the ceremony is "filler" to result in a longer engagement.
Trent Reznor (Nine Inch Nails) wrote on his blog December 6, 2007, "While the music industry is doing everything they possibly can to go out of business, can we all make sure to rid ourselves of the Grammys, too?
Out of touch old men jacking each other off.
ENOUGH!
Have a nice day".
Bono (U2) did not admit to having felt this way in the past:
He was wearing sunglasses when he stated "We called them 'The Grannys'.
Snobs, we did not want to hear anything about music from anyone older than us".
But, he continues, he changed his mind, not because of the awards themselves, but the telecast's inclusivity: "And then the Staple Singers came on...
It was all there: anger, love, forgiveness, family, community, and the deepest sense of history...
Here was the full power of American music challenging my arrogance.
I watched the rest of the show with new eyes.
The Grammys invited jazz, country, rock, soul and classical into the same hall.
No regard for demographic studies of what would deliver ratings, no radio call-out research-- a mad amalgam of the profound and the absurd and the creeping realization that one man's Mozart is another man's Vegas".
