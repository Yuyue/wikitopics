FlashForward is an American science-fiction television series airing on ABC.
It is based on the 1999 novel Flashforward by Canadian science fiction writer Robert J. Sawyer.
It began airing on September 24, 2009.
Production
The pilot was written by David S. Goyer (who also directed) and Brannon Braga, from Robert J Sawyer's novel, with Goyer and Braga executive producing alongside Jessika Borsiczky Goyer, Vince Gerardis, and Ralph Vicinanza.
FlashForward originally was developed at HBO, which sold its option because it thought the show would be a better fit for a broadcast network.
After purchasing the series and ordering a pilot ABC picked up FlashForward for thirteen episodes in May 2009.
ABC's pick-up of the show means Braga, who also serves as a co-executive producer on the 20th Century/Fox drama  24, will act as an executive producer on FlashForward while working full time on 24.

Season synopsis
Season 1 (2009)
The premise of FlashForward is that a mysterious paranormal event causes everyone on the planet to simultaneously lose consciousness for 137 seconds, during which people see what appear to be visions of their lives approximately six months in the future - a global “flashforward”.
A number of people saw newspapers or calendars and it is established that every vision occurs on April 29 or April 30, 2010 at the exact same time, depending on time zones at 5 am UTC.
It is also established that the precognitive visions were shared; if one character sees another in their vision, the other character also reports the same events in their vision.
The event results in deaths from accidents and leaves the survivors wondering whether what they saw will really happen.
In the pilot, a team of Los Angeles FBI agents, led by Stanford Wedeck (Courtney B. Vance) and spearheaded by protagonist Mark Benford (Joseph Fiennes), begin the process of determining what happened, why, and whether it will happen again.
Benford is in a uniquely valuable position to lead this investigation because during his flashforward, he was looking at a project board of the investigation.
The board was covered with pictures and notes, and Benford was able to remember several significant details, including a note that said "D. Gibbons".
At the end of Mark's blackout, he sees a bunch of masked gunmen (one with a three-star tatoo) trying to kill him.
He also notices a woven friendship bracelet on his wrist that he does not recognize.
Shortly thereafter, he is given a bracelet of that design by his daughter.
With the help of his team, Benford creates a website database of people's flashforwards from around the world.
He calls it the Mosaic Collective after the case he saw himself investigating during his own flashforward.
Along with various catastrophic or joyful visions, people also see themselves engaging in unexpected behavior; for example, Benford sees himself drinking again, and his wife Olivia (Sonya Walger) has an intimate vision of herself with an unknown man.
Some see themselves in unusual locations or see unanticipated events, such as a pregnancy for a woman who doesn't have a boyfriend.
In some cases, the event prevents actions from occurring such as Olivia's intern Bryce who was on the verge of committing suicide.
Mark's partner Demetri (John Cho), had no vision of the future, and worries about what this means.
In the last scene of the premiere, CCTV tape shows a character in black walking through a baseball stadium in Detroit while all around him, people have blacked out.
This character is labeled "Suspect Zero" and becomes the focus of the team's search.
In the second episode, the investigation ends up in Utah, Benford notices an abandoned doll factory across the street from the bus stop.
He remembers in his flashforward that there was a picture of a burnt doll head.
On entering, Benford and his team realise there is someone in there.
After a chase, they exchange shots and the man detonates an explosive device which destroys the lab.
In the aftermath of a fire, Benford sees a photographer taking pictures of the evidence.
He looks at the pictures on the camera, and sees the exact picture he remembered from his vision.
It is revealed that the man in the doll factory was trying to hack into various government agencies looking for information about the flashforward event.
After analysing the hacker's cell phone calls, it is discovered that a call was made during the blackout to "Suspect Zero".
The team now knows there are at least two people who were awake during the blackout, and that they were in communication.
Benford's daughter, Charlie tells no one the contents of her vision, other than it has apparently terrified her.
Demetri receives a phone call from a woman in Hong Kong who tells him she knows that he will be murdered March 15, 2010.
In the final scene of that episode, Charlie tells her dad that "D Gibbons is a bad man".
In the third episode, Demetri's conversation with the mysterious woman from Hong Kong continues and cannot or will not provide anymore information other than when he will be murdered.
The FBI receives several theories from different agencies of what they think caused the blackouts.
One from Germany especially catches their attention, when Benford realizes that a former Nazi, that is being held in jail, has information on what was going on as he saw him in his flashforward.
They go to Germany and broker a deal, the guy will provide the information for his freedom.
He tells them of his vision and what he saw.
They confirm that it is genuine.
He then tells them that when he woke up he noticed on the ground outside his jail crows laid dead on the ground.
He then informs them that it was a ruse to get his freedom.
He does leave them a book on birds to help figure out what it means.
Aaron goes and sees his ex-wife and asks her to sign a document that would allow him to exhume their daughters remains.
His wife flat out refuses to sign.
Aaron asks that Benford help him.
Benford agrees and Aaron's daughter is exhumed.
He later discovers that the body is indeed their daughter's and he and his ex-wife share a tear for their loss.
The FBI have a memorial service for their fallen comrades.
Stanford Wedeck's wife tells Olivia that in her vision she saw a child in her son's room.
A boy that she has never seen before.
At the funeral, she sees that boy and realizes that he will become a part of her family in the future.
At a bar the Agents are toasting their fallen comrades when Benford comes to realize something.
He gets Janis to help him.
He gets her to check to see if crows had died anywhere else in the world and indeed crows died all at the same time.
They also discover that it happened before in Somalia where scientists were sent to investigate strange blackouts.
Benford then begins to wonder not if it will happen again, but if it happened before.
Flashback to 1991 Somalia.
A boy is herding his goats when he sees crows flying overhead and then suddenly they start falling dead, laying next to the unconscious bodies of other villagers.
Looking up he sees a strange local movement of mist around the top of a tall tower in the village.
