2) #171
Flubber

Foxx
Raven Darkholme
Mystique infiltrated the X-Men while posing as Foxx from X-Men (vol.
2) #171 to X-Men (vol.
2) #172.
She was then discovered by the X-Men and voted in as a probationary member.
Onyxx
Sidney Green
Team leader.
Was in love with Foxx but she rejected him.
Rain Boy
Marco DePolo
More than likely depowered.
Other member?
The squads were each meant to have six members, but only four were shown before Mystique's arrival.
That's why the other may be dead or non-existent.
It is also possible that Gambit's squad was in the process of being formed upon their comic debut.
Lower school
Left in charge of Karma.
It is made up by the students who are too young to be in a squad.

Jeffrey Garrett
X-Treme X-Men #20
Died while teleporting during Magneto's attack on the school in New X-Men #147.
Was revealed to have "survived" as a ghost in New X-Men: Academy X #9.
He disappeared after M-Day meaning his ghost state may have been a side-effect of his powers.

2)  #23
He was confirmed off-panel to have been in Storm's squad.
His mutant ability is "Extreme Strength".
He can temporarily increase the muscle mass of his body to impossible levels.
However, he cannot sustain this form for long since it causes massive strain on his body and leads to seizures.
5 other students
None
Each squad had six students.
There must have been five other members but they are more than likely to be depowered and may have been on the bus when it exploded.
No squads known
Here are the students who were shown but whose squads were not known or who died/left before joining one.
There were two mentioned squads, the Exemplars and the Excelsiors, but no information had been given about them before they disbanded.
