Robert Anthony Plant CBE (born 20 August 1948), is an English rock singer and songwriter, famous for his membership in the rock band Led Zeppelin as the lead vocalist, as well as for his successful solo career.
He recently released an album produced by T-Bone Burnett with well known American bluegrass soprano Alison Krauss, both winning the 2009  Grammy Awards for Record of the Year and the coveted Album of the Year for their 2007 effort.
Life and career
Early career
Plant was born in West Bromwich, then Staffordshire, in West Midlands, to parents Robert C. and Annie C. (Cain) Plant, but grew up in Halesowen, formerly Worcestershire, now part of the Metropolitan Borough of Dudley.
He left  King Edward's School in Stourbridge in his mid-teens and developed a strong passion for the blues, mainly through his admiration for Elvis Presley, Willie Dixon, Robert Johnson and early rendition of songs in this genre.
He abandoned training as a chartered accountant after only two weeks to attend college in an effort to gain more GCE passes and to become part of the Midlands blues scene.
"I left home at 16", he said "and I started my real education musically, moving from group to group, furthering my knowledge of the blues and of other music which had weight and was worth listening to".
Plant's early blues influences included artists such as Robert Johnson, Bukka White, Skip James, Jerry Miller and Sleepy John Estes.
Plant did various jobs while pursuing his music career, one of which was working for the major British construction company Wimpey in Birmingham in 1967 laying tarmac on roads.
He also worked at Woolworths in Halesowen town for a short period of time.
He cut three obscure singles on CBS Records and sang with a variety of bands, including The Crawling King Snakes, which brought him into contact with drummer John Bonham.
They both went on to play in the Band of Joy, merging blues with newer psychedelic trends.
Though his early career met with no commercial success, word quickly spread about the "young man with the powerful voice".
Led Zeppelin
Early years
In 1968, the guitarist Jimmy Page was in search of a lead singer for his new band and met Plant after being turned down by his first choice, Terry Reid, who referred him to a show at a teacher training college in Birmingham— where Plant was singing in a band named Hobbstweedle.
Page explained:
When I auditioned him and heard him sing, I immediately thought there must be something wrong with him personality-wise or that he had to be impossible to work with, because I just could not understand why, after he told me he'd been singing for a few years already, he hadn't become a big name yet.
So I had him down to my place for a little while, just to sort of check him out, and we got along great.
No problems.
According to Plant:
I was appearing at this college when Peter and Jimmy turned up and asked me if I'd like to join The Yardbirds.
I knew The Yardbirds had done a lot of work in America - which to me meant audiences who would want to know what I might have to offer - so naturally I was very interested.
Plant and Page immediately hit it off with a shared musical passion and after Plant joined the band they began their writing collaboration with reworkings of earlier blues songs, although Plant would receive no songwriting credits on the band's first album, allegedly because he was still under contract to CBS Records at the time.
Plant brought along John Bonham as drummer, and they were joined by John Paul Jones, who had previously worked with Jimmy Page as a studio musician.
Initially dubbed the "New Yardbirds" in 1968, the band soon came to be known as Led Zeppelin.
The band's self-titled debut album hit the charts in 1969 and is widely credited as a catalyst for the heavy metal genre.
Plant, however, has commented that it is unfair for people to think of Zeppelin as heavy metal, as almost a third of their music was acoustic.
Later years
In 1975, he and his wife Maureen were seriously injured in a car crash in Rhodes, Greece.
This significantly affected the production of Led Zeppelin's seventh album Presence for a few months while he recovered, and forced the band to cancel the remaining tour dates for the year.
In July 1977 his oldest son Karac died of a stomach infection when Plant was engaged on Led Zeppelin's concert tour of the United States.
Plant retreated to his home in the Midlands and for months afterward he questioned his future.
Karac's death later inspired him to write the song "All My Love" in tribute, featured on Led Zeppelin's final studio LP, 1979's In Through the Out Door.
These events had a major effect on Plant, and represent a turning point in Led Zeppelin's music, as In Through The Out Door featured a lighter and more  progressive sound under the direction of John Paul Jones, with fewer of the hard-rocking numbers the band had been known for.
Plant has told an interviewer "I had a couple of bad knocks which, no matter what happens, will always have taken their toll on me.
I know that my kind of vision, or the carefree element I had, disappeared instantly when I had my automobile accident in 1975.
That kind of ramshackled 'I'll take the world now' attitude was completely gone".
Lyrics
Plant's lyrics with Led Zeppelin were often mystical, philosophical and spiritual, alluding to events in classical and Norse mythology, such as the "Immigrant Song", which refers to Valhalla and Viking conquests.
However, the song "No Quarter" is often misunderstood to refer to the god Thor; the song actually refers to Mount Thor (which is named after the god).
Another example is "The Rain Song".
Plant was also influenced by J. R. R. Tolkien, whose book series inspired lyrics in some early Led Zeppelin songs.
Most notably the "Battle of Evermore", "Misty Mountain Hop" and "Ramble On" contain verses referencing Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings.
Conversely, Plant sometimes used more straightforward blues-based lyrics dealing primarily with sexual innuendo, as in "The Lemon Song", "Trampled Under Foot", and "Black Dog".
Welsh mythology also forms a basis of Plant's interest in mystical lyrics.
He grew up close to the Welsh border and would often take summer trips to Snowdonia.
Plant bought a Welsh sheep farm in 1973, and began taking Welsh lessons and looking into the mythology of the land (such as Black Book of Carmarthen, Book of Taliesin, etc.
) Plant's first son, Karac, was named after the Welsh warrior Caratacus.
The song title "Bron-Yr-Aur Stomp" is named after the 18th Century Welsh cottage Bron-Yr-Aur owned by a friend of his father; and later inspired the song "Bron-Yr-Aur".
The songs "Misty Mountain Hop," "That's the Way," and early dabblings in what would become "Stairway to Heaven" were written in Wales and lyrically reflect Plant's mystical view of the land.
Critic Steve Turner suggests that Plant's early and continued experiences in Wales served as the foundation for his broader interest in the mythologies he revisits in his lyrics (including those myth systems of Tolkien and the Norse).
The passion for diverse musical experiences drove Plant to explore Africa, specifically Morocco, whose musical inspiration most evidently culminated in the classic track "Kashmir" (which is not in North Africa, but rather between India and Pakistan).
Both he and Jimmy Page revisited these influences during their reunion album No Quarter: Jimmy Page and Robert Plant Unledded in 1994.
In his solo career, Plant again tapped from these influences many times, most notably in the 2002 album, Dreamland.
Undoubtedly one of Plant's most significant and influential achievements with Led Zeppelin was his contribution to the track "Stairway to Heaven", an epic rock ballad featured on Led Zeppelin IV that drew influence from folk, blues, Celtic traditional music and hard rock among other genres.
Most of the lyrics of the song were written spontaneously by Plant in 1970 at Headley Grange.
While never released as a single, the song has topped charts as the greatest song of all time on various polls around the world.
Plant is also recognised for his lyrical improvisation in Led Zeppelin's live performances, often singing verses previously unheard on studio recordings.
One of the most famous Led Zeppelin musical devices involves Plant's vocal mimicking of band mate Jimmy Page's guitar effects.
This can be heard in the songs "How Many More Times", "Dazed and Confused", "The Lemon Song", "You Shook Me", "Nobody's Fault But Mine" and "Sick Again".
He is also known for his light-hearted, humorous, and unusual on-stage banter, often referred to as "plantations".
Plant often discusses the origin and background of the songs during his shows, and sometimes provides social comment as well.
He frequently talks about American blues musicians as his inspiration, mentioning artists like Robert Johnson, Howlin' Wolf, Blind Willie Johnson, and Willie Dixon at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony and the 2007 Ahmet Ertegün Tribute Concert with Led Zeppelin.
Stage persona
Plant enjoyed great success with Led Zeppelin throughout the 1970s and developed a compelling image as the charismatic rock-and-roll front man, similar to contemporaries such as Roger Daltrey of The Who and Jim Morrison of The Doors.
With his mane of long blond hair and powerful, bare-chested appearance, Plant helped perhaps more than any other artist to create the "god of rock and roll" or "rock god" archetype.
On stage, Robert was particularly active in live performances, often dancing, jumping, snapping his fingers, clapping, making emphatic gestures to emphasise a lyric or cymbal crash, throwing back his head, or placing his hands on his hips.
As the 1970s progressed he, along with the other members of Led Zeppelin, became increasingly flamboyant onstage and wore more elaborate, colourful clothing and jewelry.
According to Ian Fortnam, "once [Plant] had a couple of US tours under his belt, 'Percy' Plant swiftly developed a staggering degree of bravado and swagger that irrefutably enhanced Led Zeppelin's rapidly burgeoning appeal".
In 1994, during his "Unledded" tour with Jimmy Page, Plant himself reflected tongue-in-cheek upon his Led Zeppelin showmanship:
Solo career
After the breakup of Led Zeppelin in 1980 (following the death of John Bonham), Plant pursued a successful solo career beginning with Pictures at Eleven in 1982, followed by 1983's The Principle of Moments.
Popular tracks from this period include "Big Log" (a Top 20 hit in 1983), "In the Mood" (1984), "Little by Little" (from 1985's Shaken 'n' Stirred), "Tall Cool One" (a #25 hit off 1988's Now and Zen) and "I Believe" (from 1993's Fate of Nations), another song written for and dedicated to his late son, Karac.
In 1984, Plant formed a short-lived all-star group with Jimmy Page and Jeff Beck called The Honeydrippers, who had a #3 hit with a remake of the Phil Phillips' tune, "Sea of Love", along with a lesser hit with "Rockin' at Midnight".
Although Plant avoided performing Led Zeppelin songs through much of this period, his tours in 1983 (with superstar drummer Phil Collins) and 1985 were very successful, often performing to sold-out arena-sized venues.
Through the 1980s and 1990s, Plant co-wrote three solo albums with keyboardist/songwriter Phil Johnstone.
Now and Zen, Manic Nirvana, and Fate of Nations (featuring Máire Brennan of Clannad).
It was Johnstone who talked Plant into playing Led Zeppelin songs in his live shows, something Plant had resisted, not wanting to be forever known as "the former Led Zeppelin vocalist".
Plant first collaborated with Jimmy Page post-Zeppelin in the studio on the 1988 Page solo effort, Outrider.
He later collaborated with Page on the 1998 album, Walking into Clarksdale, which features all original material from the pair.
Starting at the close of 1999, Plant performed at several small venues with his folk-rock band, named Priory of Brion.
In 1988, Plant appeared as both a member of Led Zeppelin and as a solo artist at the Atlantic Records 40th Anniversary concert.
In 2001, Plant appeared on Afro Celt Sound System's album "Volume 3: Further in Time".
The song "Life Begin Again" features a duet with Welsh folksinger Julie Murphy, emphasizing Plant's recurring interest in Welsh culture (Murphy would also tour in support of Plant).
In 2002, with his then newly-formed band Strange Sensation, Plant released a widely acclaimed collection of mostly blues and folk remakes, Dreamland.
Contrasting with this lush collection of often relatively obscure remakes, the second album with Strange Sensation, Mighty ReArranger (2005), contains new, original songs.
Both have received some of the most favorable reviews of Plant's solo career and four Grammy nominations, two in 2003 and two in 2006.
As a former member of Led Zeppelin, along with Jimmy Page and John Paul Jones, Plant received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2005 and the  Polar Music Prize in 2006.
Plant still actively tours.
His sets typically include recent, but not only, solo material and plenty of Led Zeppelin favourites, often with new and expanded arrangements.
A DVD titled Soundstage: Robert Plant and the Strange Sensation, featuring his Soundstage performance (filmed at the Soundstage Studios in
Chicago on 16 September 2005), was released in October 2006.
An expansive box set of his solo work, Nine Lives, was released in November 2006, which expanded all of his albums with various b-sides, demos, and live cuts.
It was accompanied by a DVD.
All his solo works were re-released with these extra tracks individually.
In 2007, Plant contributed two tracks to the Fats Domino tribute album Goin' Home: A Tribute To Fats Domino, "It Keeps Rainin'" with the Lil' Band O' Gold and "Valley Of Tears" with The Soweto Gospel Choir.
On 23 June 2006, Plant was the headliner (backed by Ian Hunter's band) at the Benefit For Arthur Lee concert at New York's Beacon Theater, a show which raised money for Lee's medical expenses from his bout with leukemia.
Plant and band performed thirteen songs - five by Arthur Lee & Love, five Led Zeppelin songs and three others including a duet with Ian Hunter.
At the show, Plant told the audience of his great admiration for Arthur Lee dating back to the mid-Sixties.
Sadly, Lee died of his illness six weeks after the concert.
With Alison Krauss
Since 2007, Plant has been recording and performing with bluegrass star Alison Krauss.
A duet album, Raising Sand, was released on 23 October 2007 on Rounder Records.
The album, recorded in Nashville and Los Angeles and produced by T-Bone Burnett, includes performances of lesser-known material from R&B, Blues, folk, and country  songwriters including Mel Tillis, Townes Van Zandt, Gene Clark, Tom Waits, Doc Watson, Little Milton Campbell and the Everly Brothers.
The song "Gone Gone Gone (Done Moved On)" from Raising Sand won a Grammy for Best Pop Collaboration With Vocals in 2008.
Raising Sand  also won Album of the Year at the 51st Grammy Awards.
The album has been successful critically and commercially, and was certified platinum on 4 March 2008.
Plant and Krauss began an extended tour of the US and Europe in April 2008, playing music from Raising Sand and other American roots music as well as reworked Led Zeppelin tunes.
The album was nominated for the Mercury Prize in July 2008.
Also in 2008, Plant performed with bluegrass musicians at the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival and Bonnaroo Music & Arts Festival.
He appeared as a surprise guest during Fairport Convention's set at the 2008 Cropredy Festival, performing Led Zeppelin's The Battle of Evermore with Kristina Donahue as a tribute to Sandy Denny.
Further reference to Fairport Convention occurs in October 2008, when it is reported that Plant has collaborated on a new album by original Fairport vocalist Judy Dyble, due for release early 2009.
On February 8th, 2009, Plant and Krauss won a Grammy for Album of the Year, Record of the Year, Pop Collaboration with Vocals, Country Collaboration with Vocals, and Contemporary Folk/Americana Album.
Led Zeppelin-related projects and reunion rumours
Plant performed with both living members of Led Zeppelin in 1985 for Live Aid (with Phil Collins and Tony Thompson on drums), and in 1988 for Atlantic Records 40th anniversary, with the son of John Bonham, Jason Bonham, on drums.
Both sets featured only a few songs, performed with minimal rehearsal.
Plant was unhappy with both performances, saying that "it was like sleeping with your ex-wife but not making love".
In 1995, Led Zeppelin was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and Plant performed at the induction show with Jimmy Page, John Paul Jones, Jason Bonham, Neil Young, Steven Tyler and Joe Perry, performing spirited versions of "Bring It On Home", "Honeybee", and "When the Levee Breaks".
After years of reunion rumors, Led Zeppelin performed at full two-hour set on 10 December 2007 at the Ahmet Ertegün Tribute Concert, with Jason again filling in on drums.
Despite enormous public demand, Plant declined a $200 million offer to tour with Led Zeppelin after the 2007 show.
In interviews following the 2007 show, Plant left the door open to possible future performances with Led Zeppelin, saying that he enjoyed the reunion and felt that the show was strong musically.
Although Page, Jones, and Bonham have expressed the strong desire to tour as Led Zeppelin, Plant has consistently opposed a full tour and has responded negatively to questions about another reunion.
In a January, 2008 interview, he stated that he does not want to "tour like a bunch of bored old men following the Rolling Stones around".
Because of this, the other three members have said that they're rehearsing with an American stand-in vocalist for a reunion tour, and possibly a new album.
In a statement on his web site in late 2008, Plant stated, "I will not be touring with Led Zeppelin or anyone else for the next two years.
Anyone buying Led Zeppelin tickets will be buying bogus tickets".
Legacy
Plant became one of the most significant rock singers of the genre and influenced the style of many of his contemporaries, including Ann Wilson, Sammy Hagar, Rob Halford,
and later rock vocalists such as Jeff Buckley.
In 2003, Rolling Stone magazine named Plant as number 15 on their list of the 100 Greatest Singers of All-Time.
He was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2009 New Year Honours.
