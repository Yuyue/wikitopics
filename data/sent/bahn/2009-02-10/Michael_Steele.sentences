On February 7, 2009, Steele, through a spokesman, stated that the payments to his sister "were fully disclosed and are completely proper and in full compliance with all state and federal laws".
In 2009, it became known that Steele's former finance chairman, Alan B. Fabian, had reported to federal prosecutors that Steele used his 2006 Senate campaign fund to pay a defunct company ("Brown Sugar Unlimited") run by his sister for "catering/web services" that were never performed.
Fabian provided the information to federal prosecutors in 2008 during his plea negotiations on unrelated fraud charges (for which he was sentenced to 9 years in prison).
After the sixth vote, he won the chairmanship of the RNC over Dawson by a vote of 91 to 77.
