Billy Bob Thornton (born August 4, 1955) is an American screenwriter, actor and occasional director, playwright and singer.
His rise to fame began in the mid-1990s, after writing, directing, and starring in the film Sling Blade, for which he won an Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay; he has since established a successful career as a film actor in Hollywood.
Thornton has been described in media reports as "Hollywood's go-to alpha male".
Early life
Thornton was born in Hot Springs, Arkansas, the son of Virginia Roberta (née Faulkner), an alleged psychic, and William Raymond (Billy Ray) Thornton, a high-school history teacher and basketball coach.
He is the oldest of four sons.
Thornton lived in both Alpine, Arkansas and Malvern, Arkansas during his childhood, and also spent time with his grandfather, Otis Thornton, a forest ranger, in a small shack in the woods.
Thornton is the cousin of noted professional wrestlers Dory Funk, Jr. and Terry Funk.
He was raised a Methodist.
A good high school baseball player, he tried out for the Kansas City Royals, but was let go after an injury.
After a short period laying asphalt for the Arkansas State Transportation Department, he attended Henderson State University, in Arkadelphia, Arkansas, to pursue studies in psychology, but dropped out after two semesters.
In the late 1980s, Thornton settled in Los Angeles, to pursue his career as an actor, with future writing partner Tom Epperson.
Thornton initially had a difficult time succeeding as an actor, and worked in telemarketing, offshore wind farming, and fast-food management between auditioning for acting jobs.
He also played drums and sang with South African rock band Jack Hammer.
While Thornton worked as a waiter for an industry event, he served film director Billy Wilder and struck up a conversation with Wilder, who advised Thornton to consider a career as a screenwriter, for which he eventually won an Oscar in the category of best screenplay.
Career
Thornton first came to semi-prominence as a cast member on the CBS sitcom Hearts Afire with John Ritter and Markie Post.
His role as the villain in 1992's One False Move, which he also cowrote, brought him to the attention of critics.
He also had small roles in the early 1990s films Indecent Proposal, On Deadly Ground, Bound by Honor, Grey Knight, and Tombstone.
Thornton put Wilder's advice to good use, and went on to write, direct and star in the independent film Sling Blade, which was released in 1996.
The film, an expansion of a short film titled Some Folks Call It a Sling Blade, introduced the story of Karl Childers, a mentally handicapped man imprisoned for a gruesome and seemingly inexplicable murder.
Sling Blade garnered international acclaim.
Thornton's screenplay earned him an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay, a Writers Guild of America Award, and an Edgar Award, while his performance received Oscar and Screen Actors Guild nominations for Best Actor.
In 1998, he portrayed the James-Carville-like Richard Jemmons in Primary Colors.
Thornton adapted the book All the Pretty Horses into a 2000 film with the same name, starring Matt Damon and Penélope Cruz.
The negative experience (he was forced to cut more than an hour) led to his decision to never direct another film (a subsequent release, Daddy and Them, had been filmed earlier).
Also in 2000, an early script which he and Tom Epperson wrote together was made into The Gift which starred Cate Blanchett, Hilary Swank, Keanu Reeves, Katie Holmes and Giovanni Ribisi.
During the late 1990s, Thornton, who has had a life-long love for music, began a career as a singer-songwriter.
He released a roots rock album titled Private Radio in 2001, and two more albums, The Edge of the World (2003) and Hobo (2005).
Thornton was the singer of a blues rock band named Tres Hombres.
Guitarist Billy Gibbons referred to the band as "The best little cover band in Texas", and Thornton bears a tattoo with the band's name on it.
He performed the Warren Zevon song The Wind on the tribute album Enjoy Every Sandwich: Songs of Warren Zevon.
Thornton recorded a cover of the Johnny Cash classic "Ring of Fire" for the Oxford American magazine's Southern Music CD in 2001.
Thornton's screen persona has been described by the press as that of a "tattooed, hirsute man's man".
He appeared in several major film roles following Sling Blade 's success, including 1998's Armageddon and A Simple Plan, 2001's Monster's Ball and 2004's The Alamo, in which he played Davy Crockett.
He played a malicious mall Santa Claus in 2003's Bad Santa, a black comedy that performed well at the box office and established Thornton as a leading comic actor.
Thornton has stated that, following Bad Santa's success, audiences "like to watch [him] play that kind of guy," and "they [casting directors] call [him] up when they need an asshole.
It's kinda that simple... you know how narrow the imagination in this business can be".
He appeared in the comic film School for Scoundrels, which was released on September 29, 2006.
In the film, he plays a self-help doctor; the role was written specifically for Thornton.
His most recent film roles were The Astronaut Farmer, a drama released on February 23, 2007, and the comedy, Mr. Woodcock, in which Thornton plays a sadistic gym teacher.
He will next star in the drama Peace Like a River.
Thornton has also expressed an interest in directing another film, possibly a period piece about cave explorer Floyd Collins, based on the book Trapped!
The Story of Floyd Collins by Robert K. Murray and Roger Brucker.
In September 2008, Thorton starred in the big brother action movie Eagle Eye along side Shia LaBeouf and Michelle Monaghan.
Thornton received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on October 7, 2004.
CBC interview and Canadian tour
On April 8, 2009 he appeared on the national CBC Radio One program Q, hosted by Jian Ghomeshi, with the rest of his musical group The Boxmasters.
During the first half of the interview, Thornton sounded nervous and confused, giving erratic answers, such as "I don't know" when asked how long the band had been together.
When asked about his musical tastes and influences as a child, he gave his longest answer, but it was about his favorite "Famous Monsters of Filmland" magazine.
He also stated that he had "instructed" the show's producers to not ask any questions about his career as a screenwriter and actor.
Ghomeshi, in introducing the band, mentioned the acting credentials of Thornton, but never directed his questions about this other career.
Thornton, who was visibly upset, then complained about Canadians in general to a national radio audience since they didn't get up and move or throw things at the stage, referring to Canadians to being like mashed potatoes without the gravy.
This caused an outpouring of criticism from across Canada and around the world for the star's outlandish behavior.
The following night, Thornton's band opened for Willie Nelson at Toronto's prestigious Massey Hall.
A series of boos and catcalls erupted mid-set, with people in the audience yelling "here comes the gravy!
", when Thornton unsuccessfully tried to explain he liked Canadians but not the popular CBC radio host.
Local reviews of Thornton's Toronto performance have not been positive: "Nelson could teach Billy Bob Thornton more than a few things" - Globe and Mail.
On April 10, Thornton announced that the Boxmasters were dropping out of the tour early, and would not be playing with Nelson during concerts scheduled in London, Ont.
and Montreal.
Personal life
Thornton has repeatedly stated that he has obsessive–compulsive disorder.
He and rock singer Warren Zevon became close friends after sharing their common experiences with the disorder.
Various idiosyncratic behaviors have been well-documented in interviews with the actor; among these is a phobia of antique furniture — a disorder shared by the Dwight Yoakam character in the Thornton-penned Sling Blade, and by Thornton's own character in the 2001 film Bandits.
Additionally, he has stated that he has a fear of certain types of flatware, a trait assumed by his character, Hank Grotowski, in 2001's Monster's Ball, in which Grotowski insists on a plastic spoon for his daily bowl of chocolate ice cream.
In a 2004 interview with The Independent, Thornton explained: "It's just that I won't use real silver.
You know, like the big, old, heavy-ass forks and knives, I can't do that.
It's the same thing as the antique furniture.
I just don't like old stuff.
I'm creeped out by it, and I have no explanation why...I don't have a phobia about American antiques, it's mostly French — you know, like the big, old, gold-carved chairs with the velvet cushions.
The Louis XIV type.
That's what creeps me out.
I can spot the imitation antiques a mile off.
They have a different vibe.
Not as much dust".
In addition to his aversion to silver cutlery, velvet, and "creepy, castle-y stuff," Thornton confesses that "pieces from 1700 and 1800 France and England really freak me out, especially harpsichords".
Thornton lives in Los Angeles.
He has been married five times, most notably to actress Angelina Jolie.
The pair were known for their eccentric behavior, which reportedly included wearing vials of each others' blood around their necks; Thornton later clarified that the "vials" were, instead, two small lockets, each containing only a single drop of blood.
Thornton and Jolie adopted a child from Cambodia whom they named Maddox.
Jolie's divorce petition defined the child as both her and Thornton's, and requested the Court grant her custody and Thornton reasonable parenting-time.
Thornton is the biological father of four children: (with his first wife, Melissa Gatlin) Amanda Spence, born June 30, 1979, (with his fourth wife, Pietra Cherniak) William Langston, born June 27, 1993, and Harry James, born June 19, 1994, and (with current girlfriend, Connie Angland) Bella, born September 22, 2004.
Thornton has also stated that he will likely not marry again; he has specified that he believes marriage "doesn't work" for him.
His oldest and youngest child have a 'massive' 25 year age gap.
He has 3 younger brothers and his two youngest brothers are twins.
He and his youngest brothers have a 15 year age gap.
