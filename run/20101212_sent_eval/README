Overview
========

This experiment is to evaluate the varioius sentence selection scheme.
The gold standard is Ben's sentence selection.

The kinds of selection scheme:

First: Select the first sentence.
Recent: Select the most recent sentence.

Scripts
=======

There are three kinds of scripts: data generation, preprocess, and evaluation.

Data Generation
---------------
These scripts generate test data according to the schemes.
The generated data are located in the data/clustering/sent directory.

First:
src/serif/batch_pick_first.sh ../../data/clustering/sent/manual/2009-01-27/ ../../data/clustering/sent/auto-first/2009-01-27/

Recent:
src/serif/batch_pick_recent_dates.sh ../../data/clustering/serif/2009-01-27 2009-01-27 ../../data/clustering/sent/auto-recent/2009-01-27/

Preprocess
----------
Print the line number of the selected sentences for evaluation.
