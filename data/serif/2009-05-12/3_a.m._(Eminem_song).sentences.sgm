"3am" is the second official single by American rapper Eminem from his upcoming album Relapse.
The single was produced by Dr. Dre, along with most of the album, and was released on April 23, 2009 through Shade 45.
The song was released onto the iTunes music store April 28, 2009.
A music video was released on May 2 at 10:00pm via Cinemax.
Concept
The song deals with darker themes (murder, drugs etc.
), pitting Eminem as a serial killer as he questions his own sanity and recalls various homicidal incidents.
The song, according to Eminem, is said to be closer to the overall sound of the album, as opposed to the poppy, fun-poking "We Made You".
It features Eminem presumably rapping from the perspective of his alter ego Slim Shady, utilizing both internal and multi-syllabic rhyme schemes in his three verses.
Eminem quotes a famous line from the movie, The Silence of the Lambs, - "She puts the lotion in the bucket, it puts the lotion on the skin, or else she gets the hose again".
This is the third time Eminem uses a reference to The Silence of the Lambs, which was also referred to in the D12 song American Psycho from Devil's Night and the music video for "You Don't Know" from Eminem Presents: The Re-Up  with Eminem being restrained in a similar trolley and muzzle to that of Hannibal Lecter's.
Eminem also imitates Hannibal Lecter's trademark lip-licking motion to Jodie Foster when, in the beginning of the video, Eminem is visited at his cell by a female FBI Agent who looks similar to Foster's character in The Silence of the Lambs.
References to Hannah Montana and Kim Kardashian are also made.
Reception
Simon Vozick-Levinson of Entertainment Weekly gave the song a positive review, as while he said "This is, more or less, the Eminem I've been waiting for.(...
)Nobody finds poetry in violence and perviness like Marshall"., he said "he's still rapping in a silly accent for some reason(...)He's a majorly offensive verbal acrobat, the world's most eloquent sociopath".
Joseph Barracato from The New York Post also commented on the song, as well as the other singles from Relapse, giving positive reviews regarding the song and the rapper's comeback.
Music video
On Shade 45, Eminem announced that shooting for the video had been entirely complete and was shot in Detroit at 3 am with director Syndrome (who's also working on the video for Crack a Bottle).
It premiered on Cinemax, May 2 right before the movie The Strangers.
It follows Eminem playing a serial killer who is escaping from a rehabilitation clinic and killing everyone who might try to stop him.
The video takes place at Popsomp Hills Rehabilitation Center (read: Pop Some Pills) in Detroit, MI; the name of a fake rehabilitation clinic, which serves as a viral campaign for the release of Relapse".

The music video shows innocent murder victims laying bloody, beaten and helpless after what seems to be a killing spree performed by none other than Slim Shady.
The song and video suggests that it is a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde theme, being Eminem as the good and Slim Shady as the evil.
Shady roams the halls of Popsomp Hills at 3 A.M. and violently slaughters members of the staff on duty and warns us "It's 3 A.M. and here I come so you should probably run".
Eminem is also showing watching the music video to "Crack a Bottle" on TV, which is yet to be released, and is being directed by Syndrome too.
Charts
"3am" debuted at number thirty two on the Billboard Hot 100, selling 66,000 downloads in its first week, hence making a Hot Shot Debut on the chart.
