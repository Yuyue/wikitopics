Fictional character biography
Legacy Virus
Chris Bradley was first introduced as a young boy began suffering from increasingly painful headaches.
The headaches accumulated into his electrical mutant powers manifested and grew out of control in the middle of school, leaving him unconscious.
He was rescued however by Jean Grey and Gambit, who had been sent by Professor Xavier to keep an eye on him and approach him should his powers reveal themselves.
After taking him home, the X-Men offered him training at the Xavier Institute for Gifted Youngsters.
At first Chris was reluctant, but after being shunned by his best friend, agreed to join the school.
Chris spent several weeks at the school, quickly developing close friendships with the X-Men, particularly Iceman, whose own youthful personality seemed to connect well with Chris'.
However, when the Beast ran a medical test on Chris, it was revealed that he was infected with the Legacy Virus, which would eventually kill him.
Chris was of course afraid of what his future would hold, but Iceman and the other X-Men offered him aid should he ever need it.
Unfortunately, during the X-Men: Zero Tolerance storyline, in which the mutant hating Bastion began to target the X-Men, they lost touch with Chris.
This left Bradley hurt with feelings of abandonment, particularly as his illness was growing steadily worse.
New Warriors/Bolt
He soon found a mentor in Maverick who was also suffering from the Legacy Virus.
Chris stayed with him for a while before joining the New Warriors.
After the break-up of his New Warriors team, he teamed up again with Maverick.
Maverick
When Maverick disappeared and was believed dead, Bolt took the Maverick alias for himself and joined the Underground, a group founded by Cable to battle Weapon X and expose its existence.
Following the group's defeat, Chris remained in the Underground, though it was taken over by Marrow and remade into a new incarnation of the extremist mutant supremacist group Gene Nation.
Chris did not leave as he wanted to undermine Gene Nation from within and preventing its terrorist attacks, though he was ultimately killed by his former mentor himself, now bearing the codename "Agent Zero", who did not find out Chris had been the new Maverick until it was too late.
Ironically, disgusted by Agent Zero and not wanting to know his true identity, Chris died in his arms, stating that he took on Maverick's persona in order to ensure that his mentor's name would live on and that he wanted his mentor to be proud of him.

Film
Dominic Monaghan plays Chris Bradley/Bolt in the 2009 film X-Men Origins: Wolverine.
At first, it was reported he was going to play Barnell Bohusk in the movie, but it was later revealed he was going to play Bolt.
Bradley is not mentored by David North, but is his teammate.
Bradley is a part of Team X, alongside Logan, Victor Creed, Agent Zero, Fred Dukes, John Wraith and Wade Wilson, and is led by Maj. William Stryker.
He has the ability to control anything electric.
Once the team disbanded, Bradley began doing shows at fairs, playing tricks on people using a light bulb.
He then is visited by Creed, who kills him after he states he always thought it would be Wade who would do the job.
His power was then given to Weapon XI to the extent that Stryker could control him via burst transmissions from a computer.
