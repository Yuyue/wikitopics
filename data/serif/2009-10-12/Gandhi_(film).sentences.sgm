Gandhi is a 1982 biographical film based on the life of Mohandas Gandhi, who led the nonviolent resistance movement against British colonial rule in India during the first half of the 20th century.
The film was directed by Richard Attenborough and stars Ben Kingsley as Gandhi.
They both won Academy Awards for their work on the film.
The film was also given the Academy Award for Best Picture and won eight Academy Awards in total.
It was an international co-production between production companies in India and the UK.
The film premiered in New Delhi on November 30, 1982.
Synopsis
The film opens with a statement from the filmmakers explaining their approach to the problem of filming Gandhi's complex life story:
The film begins with Gandhi's assassination on January 30, 1948, and his funeral.
After an evening prayer, an elderly Gandhi is helped out for his evening walk to meet a large number of greeters and admirers.
One of these visitors-Nathuram Godse-shoots him point blank in the chest.
Gandhi exclaims, "Oh, God!
" ("Hē Ram!
" historically), and then falls dead.
The film then cuts to a huge procession at his funeral, which is attended by dignitaries from around the world.
The early life of Gandhi is not depicted in the film.
Instead, the story flashes back 55 years to a life-changing event: in 1893, Gandhi is thrown off a South African train for being an Indian and traveling in a first class compartment despite having a first class ticket.
Gandhi realizes that the laws are biased against Indians and decides to start a non-violent protest campaign for the rights of all Indians in South Africa.
After numerous arrests and garnering the unwanted attention of the world, the government finally relents by recognizing rights for Indians, though not for the native blacks of South Africa.
After this victory, Gandhi is invited back to India, where he is now considered something of a national hero.
He is urged to take up the fight for India's independence from the British Empire.
Gandhi agrees, and mounts a non-violent non-cooperation campaign of unprecedented scale, coordinating millions of Indians nationwide.
There are some setbacks, such as violence against the protesters and Gandhi's occasional imprisonment.
Nevertheless, the campaign generates great attention, and Britain faces intense public pressure.
Too weak from World War II to continue enforcing its will in India, Britain finally grants India's independence.
Indians celebrate this victory, but their troubles are far from over.
Religious tensions between Hindus and Muslims erupt into nation-wide violence.
Gandhi declares a hunger strike, saying he will not eat until the fighting stops.
The fighting does stop eventually, but the country is divided by religion.
It is decided that the northwest area of India, and eastern part of India (current day Bangladesh), both places where Muslims are in the majority, will become a new country called Pakistan (West and East Pakistan respectively).
It is hoped that by encouraging the Muslims to live in a separate country, violence will abate.
Gandhi is opposed to the idea, and is even willing to allow Muhammad Ali Jinnah to become the first prime minister of India, but the Partition of India is carried out nevertheless.
Gandhi spends his last days trying to bring about peace between both nations.
He thereby angers many dissidents on both sides, one of whom finally gets close enough to assassinate him in a scene at the end of the film that recalls the opening.
As Godse shoots Gandhi, the film fades to black and Gandhi is heard in a voiceover, saying "Oh God".
The audience then sees Gandhi's cremation; the film ending with a scene of Gandhi's ashes being scattered on the holy Ganga.
As this happens, we hear Gandhi in another voiceover:
As the list of actors is seen at the end, the hymn "Raghupati Raghava Raja Ram" is heard.
gandhi is an asshole
Historical accuracy
The film is generally accurate in its depiction of the outline of Gandhi's life and the Indian struggle for independence.
Most of the major characters in the film were specific historical figures rather than being composites or entirely fictitious.
There is, however, considerable debate over what the filmmakers chose not to portray, and the interpretations of the events.
For instance, some critics have argued that the film depicts Jinnah in an unfairly harsh light, and that it disregards Gandhi's personal flaws.
An example of a particular detail in the film that differed from reality is that the film depicts Gandhi being beaten in South Africa for burning identity passes.
While that protest did indeed happen, Gandhi was hit a couple of times but not beaten as depicted in the movie.
Production
Shooting began on November 26, 1980 and ended on May 10, 1981.
Approximately 400,000 extras were used in the funeral scene, the most for any film according to Guinness World Records.
Cast
During pre-production, there was much speculation  as to who would play the role of Gandhi.
The choice was Ben Kingsley who is partly of Indian heritage (his father was Gujarati and his birth name is Krishna Bhanji).
Casting director for the film was Dolly Thakore, an Indian theatre actress who later went on to be casting director in several British Indian films.

Precursors
This film had been Richard Attenborough's dream project, although two previous attempts at filming had been attempted and failed.
In 1952, Gabriel Pascal secured an agreement with the Prime Minister of India (Pandit Nehru) to produce a film of Gandhi's life.
However, Pascal died in 1954 before preparations were completed.
Later David Lean and Sam Spiegel planned to make a film about Gandhi after completing The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957), reportedly with Alec Guinness as Gandhi.
Ultimately, the project was abandoned in favour of Lawrence of Arabia (1962).
Critical response
Reviews were broadly positive.
Many years later the movie received an 85% "fresh" rating on the Rotten Tomatoes website.
Ben Kingsley's performance was especially praised.
Historian Lawrence James was one of the few who took a more negative view of the film.</blockquote>
