Star Trek is a 2009 science fiction film directed by J.
J. Abrams, written by Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman, and produced by Damon Lindelof and Bryan Burk.
It is the eleventh film based on the Star Trek franchise and features the main characters of the original Star Trek series, who are portrayed by a new cast.
It explores the backstories of James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) and Spock (Zachary Quinto), before they unite aboard the USS Enterprise to combat Nero (Eric Bana), a Romulan from the future who threatens the United Federation of Planets.
The film will be released in conventional theaters and some IMAX theaters on May 8, 2009, following a limited number of advanced screenings starting at 7pm the night before.
Development of the film began in 2005 when Paramount Pictures contacted Abrams, Orci and Kurtzman for ideas to revive the franchise.
The creative team contrasted Orci and Lindelof, who consider themselves "Trekkies", with casual fans like Abrams, who all aimed to create a film that would interest a general audience.
They wanted to be faithful to Star Trek canon, but they also introduced elements of their favorite novels, modified continuity with the time travel storyline, and modernized the production design of the original show.
Filming took place from November 2007 to April 2008 under intense secrecy.
Midway through the shoot, Paramount chose to delay the release date from December 25, 2008 to May 8, 2009, believing the film could reach a wider audience.
Cast
Chris Pine as James T. Kirk.
Pine described his first audition as awful, because he could not take himself seriously as a leader.
Abrams did not see Pine's first audition, and it was only after Pine's agent met Abrams' wife that the director decided to give him another audition opposite Quinto.
Quinto was supportive of Pine's casting because they knew each other as they worked out at the same gym.
After getting the part, Pine sent William Shatner a letter and received a reply containing the original Kirk's approval.
Pine watched classic episodes and read encyclopedias about the Star Trek universe, but stopped as he felt weighed down by feeling he had to copy Shatner.
Pine felt he had to show Kirk's "humor, arrogance and decisiveness", but not Shatner's speech pattern, which would have bordered on imitation.
Pine said when watching the original series, he was also struck by the humorousness of Shatner's performance.
Instead, Pine chose to incorporate elements of Tom Cruise from Top Gun and Harrison Ford's portrayals of Indiana Jones and Han Solo.
Jimmy Bennett plays James Kirk as a boy.
Zachary Quinto as Spock.
Quinto pursued the role as he was interested in the duality of Spock's half-human, half Vulcan heritage, and how "he is constantly exploring that notion of how to evolve in a responsible way and how to evolve in a respectful way.
I think those are all things that we as a society, and certainly the world, could implement".
For the audition, he wore a blue shirt and flattened his hair down to feel more like Spock.
He bound his fingers to practice the Vulcan salute, shaved his eyebrows and grew and dyed his hair for the role.
He conveyed many of Spock's attributes, such as his stillness and the way Nimoy would hold his hands behind his back.
Quinto commented the physical transformation aided in portraying an alien, joking "I just felt like a nerd.
I felt like I was 12 again.
You look back at those pictures and you see the bowl cut.
There's no question I was born to play the Spock role.
I was sporting that look for a good four or five years".
Adrien Brody had discussed playing the role with the director before Quinto was cast.
Leonard Nimoy reprises his role as the old Spock, who has come from the future to provide help.
Nimoy befriended Quinto after being cast in the role.
Although Quinto watched some episodes of the show during breaks in filming, Nimoy was his main resource in playing Spock.
Abrams and the writers met Nimoy at his house; Orci recalled the actor gave a Who are you guys and what are you up to?
' vibe" before being told how important he was to them.
He was silent, and Nimoy's wife Susan Bay told the creative team he had remained in his chair after their conversation, emotionally overwhelmed by his decision after turning down many opportunities to revisit the role.
Had Nimoy disliked the script, production would have been delayed for it to be rewritten.
He was "genuinely excited" by the script's scope and its detailing of the characters' backstories, saying, "We have dealt with [Spock being half-human, half-Vulcan], but never with quite the overview that this script has of the entire history of the character, the growth of the character, the beginnings of the character and the arrival of the character into the Enterprise crew".
Abrams said "it was surreal to direct him as Spock, because what the hell am I doing there?
This guy has been doing it for forty years.
It's like 'I think Spock would...
Jacob Kogan plays Spock as a child.
Karl Urban as Dr. Leonard "Bones" McCoy.
Like Pine, Urban said of taking on the role that "it is a case of not doing some sort of facsimile or carbon copy, but really taking the very essence of what DeForest [Kelley] has done and honoring that and bringing something new to the table".
Urban has been a fan of the show since he was seven years old and actively pursued the role after rediscovering the series on DVD with his son.
Urban was cast at his first audition, which was two months after his initial meeting with Abrams.
He said he was happy to play a role with lots of comedy, something he had not done since The Price of Milk, because he was tired of action-oriented roles.
When asked why McCoy is so cantankerous, Urban joked the character might be a "little bipolar actually!
" Orci and Kurtzman had collaborated with Urban on Xena: Warrior Princess, in which he played Caesar.
Simon Pegg as Montgomery "Scotty" Scott.
To perform Scotty's accent, Pegg was assisted by his Scottish wife.
He described Scotty as a positive Scottish stereotype, noting "Scots are the first people to laugh at the fact that they drink and fight a bit", and that Scotty comes from a long line of Scots with technical expertise, such as John Logie Baird and Alexander Graham Bell.
Years before, Pegg's character in Spaced joked that every odd-numbered Star Trek film being "shit" was a fact of life.
Pegg noted "Fate put me in the movie to show me I was talking out of my ass".
Chris Doohan, the son of the original Scotty, James Doohan, makes a cameo appearance in the transporter room.
Pegg has e-mailed Doohan about the role, and the actor has promised him his performance "would be a complete tribute to his father".
Chris Doohan previously cameoed in Star Trek: The Motion Picture.
Paul McGillion auditioned for Scotty, and he impressed producers enough that he was given another role in the film.
Zoe Saldana as Uhura.
Abrams had liked her work and requested that she play the role.
Saldana never saw the original series, but agreed to play the role after Abrams had complimented her.
"For an actor, that's all you need, that's all you want.
To get the acknowledgment and respect from your peers," she said.
She met with Nichelle Nichols, who explained to her how she had created Uhura's background, and also named the character.
Sydney Tamiia Poitier also auditioned for the part.
John Cho as Hikaru Sulu.
Abrams was concerned about casting a Korean-American as a Japanese-American character, but George Takei explained to the director that Sulu was meant to represent all of Asia on the Enterprise, so Abrams went ahead with Cho.
Cho acknowledged being an Asian-American, "there are certain acting roles that you are never going to get, and one of them is playing a cowboy.
[Playing Sulu] is a realization of that dream â€” going into space".
He cited the masculinity of the character as being important to him, and spent two weeks fight training.
Cho suffered an injury to his wrist during filming, although a representative assured it was "no big deal".
James Kyson Lee was interested in the part, but because Quinto was cast as Spock, the producers of the TV show Heroes did not want to lose another cast member for three months.
Anton Yelchin as Pavel Chekov: As with the rest of the cast, Yelchin was allowed to choose what elements there were from their predecessor's performances.
Yelchin decided to carry on Walter Koenig's speech patterns of replacing "v"s with "w"s, although he and Abrams felt this was a trait more common of Polish accents than Russian ones.
He described Chekov as an odd character, being a Russian who was brought on to the show "in the middle of the Cold War".
He recalled a "scene where they're talking to Apollo [who says], 'I am Apollo.
' And Chekov is like, 'And I am the czar of all Russias.
' [...] They gave him these lines.
I mean he really is the weirdest, weirdest character".
Eric Bana as Nero, the film's time-travelling Romulan villain.
Part of his past involves escaping from the Klingon prison Rura Penthe.
Bana shot his scenes toward the end of filming.
He was "a huge Trekkie when [he] was a kid", but had not seen many of the films.
Even if he were "crazy about the original series", he would not have accepted the role unless he liked the script, which he deemed "awesome" once he read it.
Bana knew Abrams because they coincidentally shared the same agent.
Bana improvised the character's speech patterns.
Bruce Greenwood as Christopher Pike, the captain of the Enterprise.
Ben Cross as Sarek, Spock's father.
Winona Ryder as Amanda Grayson, Spock's mother.
Clifton Collins, Jr. as General Ayel, Nero's henchman.
Chris Hemsworth as George Samuel Kirk, Sr., Kirk's father, who died aboard the USS Kelvin while battling the Romulans.
Jennifer Morrison as Winona Kirk, Kirk's mother.
Brad William Henke as Frank, Kirk's abusive, alcoholic uncle.
Star Trek: Enterprise star Dominic Keating auditioned for the role.
Spencer Daniels as George Samuel "Sam" Kirk, Jr., Kirk's older brother, who appears in a scene with Jimmy Bennett.
Faran Tahir as Richard Robau, George Kirk's captain.
Greg Ellis as Chief Engineer Olsen.
Rachel Nichols and Diora Baird play Orions.
Tyler Perry appears as the head of Starfleet Academy.
James Cawley appears as a Starfleet officer, while Pavel Lychnikoff and Lucia Rijker play Romulans, Lychnikoff a Commander and Rijker a CO.  W. Morgan Sheppard, who played a Klingon in Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country, appears in this film as the head of the Vulcan Science Council.
Greg Grunberg has a cameo as a result of a schedule conflict that deprived him of the role Abrams intended for him.
A tribble appears in the film.
Star Trek fan and Carnegie Mellon University professor Randy Pausch (who died on July 25, 2008) cameoed as an Enterprise crew member, and has a line of dialogue.
Majel Barrett, the widow of Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry, reprised her role as the voice of the Enterprises computer, which she completed two weeks before her death on December 18, 2008.
William Shatner wanted to appear as the old Kirk, despite the death of the character in Star Trek Generations.
He suggested the film canonize the novels where Kirk is resurrected, but Abrams argued, "You and I could come up with dozens of ways [to resurrect Kirk], but every way that we came up with felt like it was transparently fanboys trying to get Shatner in the movie".
Nimoy disliked the character's death in Generations, but felt resurrecting Kirk would also be detrimental to this film.
Shatner added he wanted to share Nimoy's major role, and did not want a cameo.
Orci and Kurtzman had written a scene for Shatner before they decided they would rather maintain continuity.
Nichelle Nichols suggested playing Uhura's grandmother, but Abrams could not write this in due to the Writers Guild strike.
Abrams was also interested in casting Keri Russell, but they deemed the role he had in mind for her too similar to her other roles.
Production
Development
At the 1968 World Science Fiction Convention, Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry declared he would make a film prequel to the television series.
The prequel concept resurfaced in the late 1980s with Ralph Winter and Harve Bennett during development of the fourth and sixth films.
For the latter, David Loughery wrote a script entitled The Academy Years, but it was shelved in light of objections from the original cast and the fan base.
In February 2005, following the financial failure of the tenth film, Star Trek Nemesis (2002), and the cancellation of the television series Star Trek: Enterprise, the franchise's executive producer Rick Berman and screenwriter Erik Jendresen were developing a new film entitled Star Trek: The Beginning.
It was to revolve around a new set of characters, led by Kirk's ancestor Tiberius Chase.
It would take place after Enterprise but before the original series, during the Earth-Romulan War.
Meanwhile in 2005, J.
J. Abrams, Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman were filming Mission: Impossible III, and Paramount asked Orci for ideas to revive the franchise: he also proposed a prequel.
The trio, plus producers Damon Lindelof and Bryan Burk felt the franchise had explored enough of what took place after the series, Orci and Lindelof consider themselves trekkies, and feel some of the Star Trek novels have canonical value, although Gene Roddenberry never considered the novels to be canon.
Kurtzman is a casual fan, while Burk was not.
Abrams' company, Bad Robot Productions produced the film with Paramount, marking the first time another company had financed a Star Trek film.
Bill Todman Jr.'s Level 1 Entertainment also co-produced the film, but during 2008 Spyglass Entertainment replaced them as financial partner.
Abrams had not seen Star Trek Nemesis because the franchise had "disconnected" for him, explaining that for him, Star Trek was about Kirk and Spock, and the other series were like "separate space adventure[s] with the name Star Trek".
Abrams also preferred Star Wars as a child.
He noted his general knowledge of Star Trek made him suitable to making a film to introduce the franchise to newcomers though, and being an optimistic person, he felt the optimistic nature of Star Trek would be a refreshing contrast to the likes of The Dark Knight.
He continued that he loved the focus on exploration in Star Trek and the idea of the Prime Directive, which forbids Starfleet to interfere in the development of primitive worlds.
However, Abrams disliked that the budgetary limitations of the original show meant they "never had the resources to actually show the adventure".
On February 23, 2007, Abrams accepted Paramount's offer to direct the film, having been only attached as producer.
He had decided "I would be so agonizingly envious of whoever stepped in and directed the movie", because he found the script "emotional", "fun", and "big" in scope.
Orci and Kurtzman felt their aim had been to impress a casual fan like Abrams with their story.
Even when filming, Abrams was nervous "with all these tattooed faces and pointy ears, bizarre weaponry and Romulan linguists, with dialogue about 'Neutral Zones' and 'Starfleet' [but] I knew this would work, because the script Alex and Bob wrote was so emotional and so relatable.
I didn't love Kirk and Spock when I began this journey â€“ but I love them now".
Writing
Orci said creating a clean reboot would have been disrespectful, and getting Leonard Nimoy in the film was very important.
"Having him sitting around a camp fire sharing his memories was never gonna cut it" though, and time travel was going to be included in the film from the beginning.
Kurtzman added the time travel creates jeopardy, unlike other prequels where viewers "know how they all died".
Abrams selected the Romulans as the villains because they had been featured less than the Klingons in the show, and thought it was "fun" to have them meet Kirk before he does in the show.
The episode of the original continuity in which Kirk becomes the first human to ever see a Romulan, "Balance of Terror", served as one of the influences for the film.
Orci said it was difficult giving a good explanation for the time travel without being gimmicky, like having Nero specifically seeking to assassinate Kirk.
A large Klingon subplot in early drafts of the script was dropped because Abrams felt "it confused the story in a [...] cool but unnecessary" manner.
Orci noted while the time travel story allowed them to alter some backstory elements such as Kirk's first encounter with the Romulans, they could not use it as a crutch to change everything and they tried to approach the film as a prequel as much as possible.
Kirk's service on the Farragut, a major backstory point to the original episode "Obsession", was left out because it was deemed irrelevant to the story of Kirk meeting Spock, although Orci felt nothing in his script precluded it from the new film's backstory.
Kirk's love interest Carol Marcus, who becomes the mother of his son in Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, was dropped from the final draft because the story needed more time to introduce the core characters.
The filmmakers sought inspiration from novels such as Prime Directive, Spock's World, and Best Destiny to fill in gaps unexplained by canon; Best Destiny particularly explores Kirk's childhood and names his parents.
One idea that was justified through information from the novels was having the Enterprise built on Earth, which was inspired by a piece of fan art of the Enterprise being built in a ship yard.
Orci had sent the fan art to Abrams to show how realistic the film could be.
Orci explained parts of the ship would have to be constructed on Earth because of the artificial gravity employed on the ship and its requirement for sustaining warp speed, and therefore the calibration of the ship's machinery would be best done in the exact gravity well which is to be simulated.
They felt free to have the ship built in Iowa because canon is ambigious as to whether it was built in San Francisco, but this is a result of the time travel rather than an embellishment.
Abrams noted the continuity of the original show itself was inconsistent at times.
Orci and Kurtzman said they wanted the general audience to like the film as much as the fans, by stripping away "Treknobabble", making it action-packed and giving it the simple title of Star Trek (to indicate to newcomers they would not need to watch any of the other films).
Abrams saw humor and sex appeal as two integral and popular elements of the show that needed to be maintained.
Orci stated being realistic and being dark were not the same thing.
Abrams, Burk, Lindelof, Orci and Kurtzman were fans of The Wrath of Khan, and also cited The Next Generation episode "Yesterday's Enterprise" as an influence.
Abrams's wife Katie was regularly consulted on the script, as were Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof's wives, to make the female characters as strong as possible.
Katie Abrams's approval of the strong female characters was partly why J.J. signed on to direct.
Orci and Kurtzman read graduate school dissertations on the series for inspiration; they noted comparisons of Kirk, Spock and McCoy to Shakespearian archetypes, and Kirk and Spock's friendship echoing that of John Lennon and Paul McCartney.
They also noted that, in the creation of this film, they were influenced by Star Wars, particularly in terms of pacing.
"I want to feel the space, I want to feel speed and I want to feel all the things that can become a little bit lost when Star Trek becomes very statelyâ€“which I love about it, but," said Orci.
Star Wars permeated in the way they wrote the action sequences; the writers approached the starships as like submarines rather than ships, to get closer to the aerial dogfights Star Wars was based on.
Burk noted Kirk and Spock's initially cold relationship mirrors how "Han Solo wasn't friends with anyone when they started on their journey".
Orci wanted to introduce strong Starfleet captains, concurring with an interviewer that most captains in other films were "patsies" included to make Kirk look greater by comparison.
The USS Kelvin, the ship Kirk's father serves on, is named after J.
J. Abrams' grandfather, as well as the temperature scale Kelvin, itself named after physicist and engineer Lord Kelvin (William Thomson).
The Kelvins captain, Richard Robau (Faran Tahir), is named after Orci's Cuban-born uncle: Orci theorized the fictional character was born in Cuba and grew up in the Middle East.
Another reference to Abrams' previous works is Slusho, which is mentioned in an Iowa bar in this film.
Abrams created the fictitious drink for Alias and it reappeared in viral marketing for Cloverfield.
The old Spock's Jellyfish ship contains a red ball, an Abrams motif dating back to the pilot of Alias.
Design
The film was primarily designed by Ryan Church and Star Trek veteran John Eaves.
Carolyn Porco of NASA was consulted on the planetary science and imagery, while the Cloverfield monster's creator Neville Page reunited with Abrams to design creatures for this film.
Industrial Light & Magic and Digital Domain created the visual effects.
Visual effects supervisors Roger Guyett and Sherri Hanson worked with Abrams on Mission: Impossible III.
Abrams avoided using bluescreen and greenscreen as much as possible, with the exception of one scene, because it "makes me insane".
Instead, he used special effects to extend the scale of sets and locations.
For example, when filming at California State University, bluescreens were placed to hide palm trees, and the Aptera Typ-1 prototype was placed in a corner of the location.
Both digital and physical makeup was used for aliens.
Abrams stated the difficulty of depicting the future was that much of modern technology was inspired by the original show, and made it seem outdated.
Thus the production design had to be consistent with the television series but also feel more advanced than the real world technology developed after it.
"We all have the iPhone that does more than the communicator," said Abrams.
"I feel like there's a certain thing that you can't really hold onto, which is kind of the kitschy quality.
That must go if it's going to be something that you believe is real".
Prop master Russell Bobbitt collaborated with Nokia on recreating the original communicator, creating a $50,000 prototype.
Another prop recreated for the film was the tricorder.
Bobbitt brought the original prop to the set, but the actors found it too large to carry when filming action scenes, so technical advisor Doug Brody redesigned it to be smaller.
The Enterprise was intended by Abrams to be a merging of its design in the show and the refitted version from the original film.
Abrams had fond memories of the reveal of the Enterprises refit in Star Trek: The Motion Picture, because it was the first time the ship felt tangible and real to him.
The iridescent pattern on the ship from The Motion Picture was maintained to give the ship depth, while model maker Roger Goodson also applied the "Aztec" pattern from The Next Generation.
Goodson also recalled Abrams also wanted to bring a "hot rod" aesthetic to the ship.
Guyett wanted the ship to have more moving parts, which stemmed from his childhood dissatisfaction with the ship's design: The new Enterprises dish can expand and move, while the fins on its engines split slightly when they begin warping.
To emphasize the size of the ship, Abrams chose different styles for various decks: the sickbay is more modern whereas the transporter and engine rooms are very industrial.
The Enterprise went through three major designs before being approved.
Production designer Scott Chambliss maintained the layout of the original bridge, including the placement of Kirk, Spock, Uhura, Sulu and Chekov's chairs, but aesthetically altered it with brighter colors to reflect the optimism of Star Trek.
Abrams joked the redesigned bridge made the Apple Store look "uncool".
At the director's behest, more railings were added to the bridge to make it look safer.
The phaser props were designed as spring-triggered barrels that revolve and glow as the setting switches from "stun" to "kill", and the transporter beam effects swirl rather than speckle.
Abrams selected Michael Kaplan to design the costumes because he had not seen any of the films, meaning he would approach the costumes with a new angle.
For the Starfleet uniforms, Kaplan followed the show's original color coding, with dark gray (almost black) undershirts and pants and colored overshirts showing each crew member's position (command officers wear gold shirts, science and medical officers wear blue, and finally, operations (technicians/engineers) and security personnel wear red.
Kaplan wanted the shirts to be more sophisticated than the originals and selected to have the Starfleet symbol patterned on them.
Kirk wears only the undershirt because he is a cadet.
Kirk and Sulu also wear extra-vehicular activity suits, which are blue and green respectively.
For Abrams, "The costumes were a microcosm of the entire project, which was how to take something that's kind of silly and make it feel real.
But how do you make legitimate those near-primary color costumes?
"
Lindelof compared the film's Romulan faction to pirates with their unique tattoos and disorganized costuming.
Their ship, the Narada, is purely practical with visible mechanics, as they are on a mission, unlike the Enterprise crew who give a respectable presentation on behalf of the Federation.
The Romulan actors spent two to four hours applying make-up: the actors had three prosthetics applied to their ears and foreheads, while Bana had a fourth prosthetic for the bitemark on his ear that extends to the back of his character's head.
The actors shaved their heads for the roles to differentiate them from Vulcans.
Previous series in the franchise attempted this by designing the Romulans with ridged foreheads.
Filming
Filming began on November 7, 2007.
The shoot was to last eighty-five days, taking place on eleven sets built at the Paramount backlot, as well as two weeks of location shooting in Iceland.
Filming was also done at the City Hall of Long Beach, California; Vasquez Rocks (a location used in the classic episode "Arena"); the San Rafael Swell in Utah; and the California State University, Northridge (which was used for establishing shots of students at Starfleet Academy).
A parking lot outside Dodger Stadium was used for a section of a Romulan drilling rig, and an industrial location was used for the Enterprise's engine room (although the rest of the ship's rooms were built as sets).
Principal photography finished on March 27, 2008, although second unit filming took place during early April in Bakersfield, California, standing in for Kirk's childhood home in Iowa.
Following the commencement of the 2007â€“2008 Writers Guild of America strike on November 5, 2007, Abrams, himself a WGA member, told Variety that while he would not render writing services for the film and intended to walk the picket line, he did not expect the strike to impact his directing of the production.
In the final few weeks before the strike and start of production, Abrams and Damon Lindelof polished the script a final time.
Abrams was frustrated that he was unable to alter lines during the strike, whereas normally they would have been able to improvise new ideas during rehearsal.
Lines may still be altered with dubbing.
Orci and Kurtzman were able to stay on set without strikebreaking because they were also executive producers on the film; they could "make funny eyes and faces at the actors whenever they had a problem with the line and sort of nod when they had something better".
Abrams was able to alter a scene where Spock combats six Romulans from a fistfight to a gunfight.
The production team maintained heavily enforced security around the film.
Karl Urban revealed, "[There is a] level of security and secrecy that we have all been forced to adopt.
I mean, it's really kind of paranoid crazy, but sort of justified.
We're not allowed to walk around in public in our costumes and we have to be herded around everywhere in these golf carts that are completely concealed and covered in black canvas.
The security of it is immense.
You feel your freedom is a big challenge".
Actors like Jennifer Morrison were only given the scripts of their scenes.
The film's shooting script was fiercely protected even with the main cast.
Simon Pegg said, "I read [the script] with a security guard near me â€“ it's that secretive".
The film's fake working title was Corporate Headquarters.
Some of the few outside of the production allowed to visit the set included Rod Roddenberry, Ronald D. Moore, Jonathan Frakes, Walter Koenig, Nichelle Nichols, Ben Stiller, Tom Cruise and Steven Spielberg (who had partially convinced Abrams to direct because he liked the script, and he even advised the action scenes during his visit).
When the shoot ended, Abrams gave the cast small boxes containing little telescopes, which allowed them to read the name of each constellation it was pointed at.
"I think he just wanted each of us to look at the stars a little differently," said John Cho.
Music
Michael Giacchino, Abrams' most frequent collaborator, composed the music for Star Trek.
He kept the original theme by Alexander Courage.
Giacchino admitted personal pressure in scoring the film, as "I grew up listening to all of that great [Trek] music, and that's part of what inspired me to do what I'm doing [...] You just go in scared.
You just hope you do your best.
It's one of those things where the film will tell me what to do".
Scoring took place from September to October 2008.
Varese Sarabande, the record label responsible for releasing albums of Giacchino's previous scores for Alias, Lost, Mission: Impossible III, and Speed Racer, will release the soundtrack for the film on May 5.
Release
In February 2008, Paramount announced they would move Star Trek from its December 25, 2008 release date to May 8, 2009.
The move was not due to the end of the WGA strike, but because the studio felt more audiences would see the film during summer rather than winter.
The film was practically finished by the end of 2008.
Paramount's decision came about after visiting the set and watching dailies, as they realized the film could appeal to a much broader audience.
Even though the filmmakers liked the Christmas release date, Damon Lindelof acknowledged it would allow more time to perfect the visual effects.
The months-long gap between the completion of the production and release meant Alan Dean Foster was allowed to watch the whole film before writing the novelization, although the novel will contain scenes absent from the final edit.
Quinto narrated the audiobook.
The film's first US screenings will be at 7pm on May 7, 2009.
The first public screening was held on April 6, 2009, at the  Alamo Drafthouse theater in Austin, Texas, hosted by writers Robert Orci, Alex Kurtzman, and producer Damon Lindelof.
The showing was publicized as a screening of Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, followed by a ten-minute preview of the new Star Trek film.
A few minutes into Khan, the film appeared to melt and Leonard Nimoy appeared on stage with Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof, asking the audience, "wouldnâ€™t you rather see the new movie?
" Following the surprise screening in Texas, the first of many premieres across the world was held at the Sydney Opera House on April 7, 2009.
For almost two years, the town of Vulcan, Alberta had campaigned to have the film premiere there, but because it had no theater, Paramount arranged instead a lottery where 300 winning residents would be taken to a prerelease screening in Calgary.
On April 11, the film was screened by 920 soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines at Camp Arifjan, Kuwait.The cast and crew were present for this showing and were also able to meet US service members at Ali Al Salem Air base in Kuwait during their visit.
Marketing
The first teaser trailer debuted in theaters with Cloverfield on January 18, 2008, which showed the Enterprise under construction.
Abrams himself directed the first part of the trailer, where a welder removes his goggles.
Professional welders were hired for the teaser.
The voices of the 1960s played over the trailer were intended to link the film to the present day; John F. Kennedy in particular was chosen because of similarities with the character of James T. Kirk and because he is seen to have "kicked off" the space race.
Orci explained that: "If we do indeed have a Federation, I think Kennedyâ€™s words will be inscribed in there someplace".
Paramount faced two obstacles in promoting the film: the "MySpace generation"'s unfamiliarity with the franchise and, the relatively weak international performance of the films.
Six months before the film's release, Abrams toured Rome; Cologne; Madrid; Paris; London; New York City and Los Angeles with 25 minutes of footage.
Abrams noted the large-scale campaign started unusually early, but this was because the release delay allowed him to show more completed scenes than normal.
The director preferred promoting his projects quietly, but concurred Paramount needed to remove Star Treks stigma.
Abrams would exaggerate his preference for other shows to Star Trek as a child to the press, with statements like "I'm not a Star Trek fan" and "this movie is not made for Star Trek fans".
Orci compared Abrams' approach to The Next Generation episode "A Matter of Honor", where William Riker is stationed aboard a Klingon vessel.
"On that ship when someone talks back to you, you would have to beat them down or you lose the respect of your crew, which is protocol, whereas on a Federation ship that would be a crime.
So we have to give JJ a little bit of leeway, when he is traveling the 'galaxy' over there where they donâ€™t know Trek, to say the things that need to be said in order to get people onto our side".
Promotional partners on the film include Nokia, Verizon Wireless, Esurance, Kellogg's, Burger King and Intel Corporation, as well as various companies specializing in home decorating, apparel, jewelry, gift items and "Tiberius," "Pon Farr" and "Red Shirt" fragrances.
Playmates Toys, who owned the Star Trek toy license until 2000, earned the merchandise rights for the new film.
The first waves will be released in March and April 2009, and another in September.
Playmates hope to continue their toy line into 2010.
The first wave consists of 3.75", 6" and 12" action figures, an Enterprise replica, prop toys and play sets.
In order to recreate the whole bridge, one would have to buy more 3.75" figures, which come with chairs and consoles to add to the main set consisting of Kirk's chair, the floor, the main console and the viewscreen.
Master Replicas, Mattel, Hasbro and Fundex Games will promote the film via playing cards, Monopoly, UNO, Scrabble, Magic 8-Ball, Hot Wheels, Tyco R/C, 20Q, Scene It?
and Barbie lines.
Some of these are based on previous Star Trek iterations rather than the film.
CBS also created a merchandising line based around Star Trek caricatures named "Quogs".
Reception
Aubrey Day of Total Film give it 4/5 stars, saying, "Buoyant, buffed and with the promise of even better to come, this is the freshest Trek in decades".
SFX magazine praised the Abrams vision for the franchise, claiming, "This summer, after Abramsâ€™s explosive epic has nerve-pinched all the opposition, back gardens and parks will ring with the sound of young boys zapping imaginary phasers as they play Kirk and Spock".
Empire magazine awarded 4/5 Stars, saying, "for the first time in the franchise, the Enterprise is a genuine thrill-ride"; however, it also notes that "Very much like its dynamic young cast, this Trek is physical and emotional, sexy and vital even, but it is not cerebral".
Garth Franklin of Dark Horizons opines about the task faced by the producers, saying "it simply can not be stated enough how effectively Abrams and his crew have revived and repositioned not just the franchise but the 'space opera' genre itself".
