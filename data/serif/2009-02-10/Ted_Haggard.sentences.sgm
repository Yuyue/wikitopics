Ted Arthur Haggard (June 27, 1956) is a former American evangelical preacher.
Known as Pastor Ted to the congregations he served, he is the founder and former pastor of the New Life Church in Colorado Springs, Colorado; a founder of the Association of Life-Giving Churches; and was leader of the National Association of Evangelicals (NAE) from 2003 until November 2006.
In November 2006, he resigned or was removed from all of his leadership positions after he admitted soliciting prostitute Mike Jones for homosexual sex and methamphetamine.
Initially Haggard denied even knowing Mike Jones, but as a media investigation proceeded he acknowledged that some allegations, such as his purchase of methamphetamine, were true.
He later added "sexual immorality" to his list of confessions.
After the scandal was publicized, Haggard entered three weeks of intensive counseling, overseen by four ministers.
In February 2007, one of those ministers, Tim Ralph, said that Haggard "is completely heterosexual".
Ralph later said he meant that therapy "gave Ted the tools to help to embrace his heterosexual side".
As of early 2009, Haggard continues to receive counseling, and now he says that he is “heterosexual with issues.”
Early life and work
Ted Haggard was born in Indiana.
His father, J. M. Haggard, a practicing veterinarian in Yorktown, Indiana, founded an international charismatic ministry, which was featured in a PBS Middletown documentary series.
In 1972, at age sixteen, Haggard became a born-again Christian after hearing a sermon from evangelist Bill Bright in Dallas, Texas.
As a co-editor of his high-school newspaper in 1974, he published remarkably frank articles which described services that were available to prevent and deal with increasingly prevalent pregnancies and STDs.
These articles scandalized his small town and embroiled him in a free-press lawsuit.
Haggard subsequently attended Oral Roberts University, a Christian university in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
According to Haggard, in November 1984, when he was an associate pastor of Bethany World Prayer Center in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, his confidant and mentor Danny Ost, a missionary to Mexico City, had a vision of Haggard founding his church in Colorado Springs.
Accordingly, Haggard moved to Colorado shortly afterwards, and founded New Life Church.
Initially, the basement of Haggard's house formed his church, which then grew to rented spaces in strip malls.
By the time he was removed from his job for a sex and methamphetamine scandal in 2006, New Life Church operated from a campus in northern Colorado Springs and reportedly had fourteen thousand members.
In 1978, Haggard married Gayle Alcorn.
The couple has five children: Christy, Marcus (1983) (founder and former pastor of Boulder Street Church, Colorado Springs), Jonathan (1989), Alex (1992), and Elliot (1995).
Ideology
Theology
Haggard has stated he believes in what is known as the Third Wave of the Holy Spirit and subscribes to the concept referred to as the Five-fold ministry – beliefs often associated with the charismatic movement.
He has stated that he believes that there is one, all-knowing God, and that humans were created to be with him.
Politics
In 2005, Haggard was listed by Time magazine as one of the top 25 most influential evangelicals in America.
Haggard was a firm supporter of former US President George W. Bush, and is sometimes credited with rallying evangelicals behind Bush during the 2004 election.
Author Jeff Sharlet reported in 2005 that Haggard "talks to… Bush or his advisers every Monday" and stated at that time that "no pastor in America holds more sway over the political direction of evangelicalism".
In a June 2005 Wall Street Journal article, "Ted Haggard, the head of the 30-million strong National Association of Evangelicals, joked that the only disagreement between himself and the leader of the Western world is automotive: Mr. Bush drives a Ford pickup, whereas he prefers a Chevy".
Haggard has stated that fighting global warming is an important issue, a divisive issue among Evangelical leaders.
Though he personally supported the Evangelical Climate Initiative, the NAE did not adopt a position.
Teachings on homosexuality
Haggard has condemned "homosexual activity.” In the documentary Jesus Camp, one scene shows a sermon where he preaches, "we don't have to debate about what we should think about homosexual activity.
It’s written in the Bible".
Although Haggard opposes same-sex marriage, he has suggested that there should be civil unions for homosexual couples.
Under Haggard's leadership, the NAE released "For the Health of the Nation: An Evangelical Call to Civic Responsibility" in late 2004, "a document urging engagement in traditional culture war issues such as abortion and gay marriage but also poverty, education, taxes, welfare and immigration".
The NAE has stated that "homosexual activity, like adulterous relationships, is clearly con­demned in the Scriptures".
Haggard developed ministry efforts towards homosexuals early in his Colorado Springs ministry.
He frequented gay bars and invited men to his congregation.
Television and movie appearances
Haggard has appeared on several broadcast network programs, including Dateline NBC and ABC's 20/20.
He also appears in the documentary Jesus Camp, the History Channel documentary The Antichrist,  as well as the HBO documentary Friends of God: A Road Trip with Alexandra Pelosi.
In early 2006, evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins interviewed Haggard as part of a British television documentary entitled The Root of All Evil?.
During this interview, Dawkins spoke with Haggard about contradictions between the cumulative knowledge produced by science, and a literal interpretation of the Bible (particularly its account of creation).
In response, Haggard claimed to "fully embrace the scientific method".
Haggard then stated that the conclusions of that method regarding the age of the earth and evolution were only the result of "some of the views that are accepted in some portions of the scientific community".
When Dawkins pointed out Haggard's misconception of the theory of evolution (for instance Haggard's notion that complex organs such as the eye spontaneously manifested), Haggard suggested that Dawkins should be less arrogant about his learning.
As Dawkins and his film crew were packing up to leave, there was a brief altercation in the church parking lot.
According to Dawkins, Haggard ordered Dawkins's crew off his land with the words, "You called my children animals," and threatened legal action and confiscation of their recording equipment.
Later, Dawkins speculated that Haggard was upset because Dawkins had talked about evolution in the interview.
Homosexual sex and methamphetamine drugs scandal
In November 2006, prostitute and masseur Mike Jones alleged that Haggard had paid Jones to engage in sex with him for three years and had also purchased and used crystal methamphetamine.
Jones said he had only recently learned of Haggard's true identity, and explained his reasons for coming forward by saying, "It made me angry that here’s someone preaching against gay marriage and going behind the scenes having gay sex".
Haggard acknowledged some, but not all, of the allegations, and was removed from all of his leadership positions in religious organizations, including the church he founded.
At first, however, he claimed he had never met his accuser and in a television interview said "I am steady with my wife.
I’m faithful to my wife".
But on November 5, in a statement Haggard said, "The fact is I am guilty of sexual immorality.
And I take responsibility for the entire problem.
I am a deceiver and a liar.
There's a part of my life that is so repulsive and dark that I have been warring against it for all of my adult life".
Allegations
On November 1, 2006, Mike Jones stated that Haggard (whom Jones knew as "Art"; Haggard's middle name is Arthur) had paid for sex with him on an almost monthly basis over the previous three years.
Jones contends the relationship was strictly physical, not emotional, and that he was typically paid a "couple of hundred dollars" but sometimes Haggard would pay him extra.
Haggard was a "bottom", according to Jones.
Jones also stated "[Haggard] had told me he loved snorting meth before [he] has sex with his wife" and that Haggard had also revealed a fantasy he had of having an orgy with "about six young college guys ranging from 18 to 22 in age".
Jones claims Haggard had often used drugs in front of him, but he said he never actually sold drugs to Haggard but instead introduced him to someone, from whom he could purchase them.
About two years ago he asked, "Hey, Mike, what do you know about meth?
" "I don’t do it personally, but I know people who do".
I told him that some people think it enhances their sexual experience.
He asked if I could help him get some.
I located someone he could connect with.
After that, he got it on his own.
The last time he saw me, he was trying to get some and couldn't, which resulted in him sending me money through the mail in August, postmarked Colorado Springs.
He wrote "Art" on the corner of the envelope.
I just read that his middle name is Arthur....
Jones said he made his outing allegations against Haggard in response to Haggard's political support for a Colorado Amendment 43 on the November 7, 2006 Colorado ballot that would ban same-sex marriage in that state.
Jones told ABC News, "I had to expose the hypocrisy.
He is in the position of influence of millions of followers, and he's preaching against gay marriage.
But behind everybody's back [he's] doing what he's preached against".
Jones hoped that his statements would sway voters.
Voice analysis expert Richard Sanders compared the voice of Haggard from a television interview to that of the voicemails released by Jones and announced preliminary results stating that the voice on the voicemail is most likely that of Haggard.
According to an article from KUSA, "Sanders makes his decision by comparing the resonance of the voice, the play of one's tongue and the inflection of vowel sounds".
Jones volunteered to take a polygraph test on a KHOW radio show hosted by Peter Boyles, where Jones first made the allegations.
However, Jones's responses during the section of the polygraph test about whether he had engaged in sex with Haggard indicated deception.
The test administrator, John Kresnik, discounted the test results because of Jones's stress and lack of eating or sleeping.
Regardless, Haggard responded by saying "We're so grateful that he failed a polygraph test this morning, my accuser did".
Jones was not asked questions about drug use.
Jones expressed doubt that he would retake the test, saying "I've made my point.
He's the one who has discredited himself.
He should admit it and move on".
Rumors prior to the Jones allegations
Greg Montoya, editor of Out Front Colorado, a Denver LGBT newspaper, told the Colorado Springs Gazette that "rumors about Haggard's love life have circulated through Denver's gay community for the past year.
But we didn't know it involved Mike Jones.
'"
Montoya's disclosure was paralleled by Lou Sheldon, chairman of the Traditional Values Coalition and a self-proclaimed friend of Haggard, who told New York's The Jewish Week that he and "a lot" of other people had been aware of Pastor Haggard's same-sex behavior "for a while... but we weren't sure just how to deal with it.... Ted and I had a discussion.
He said homosexuality is genetic.
I said, "yes it is".
But I just knew he was covering up.
They need to say that".
Response to allegations
Haggard initially claimed he had never heard of his accuser and denied having ever done drugs and stated "I have not, I have never had a gay relationship with anybody".
Many evangelical leaders initially showed support for Haggard and were critical of media reports.
James Dobson issued a news release stating, "It is unconscionable that the legitimate news media would report a rumor like this based on nothing but one man's accusation.
Ted Haggard is a friend of mine and it appears someone is trying to damage his reputation as a way of influencing the outcome of Tuesday's election—especially the vote on Colorado's marriage-protection amendment—which Ted strongly supports".
Later however, Haggard resigned as president of the National Association of Evangelicals.
He went on administrative leave from his position as senior pastor of New Life Church, saying "I am voluntarily stepping aside from leadership so that the overseer process can be allowed to proceed with integrity.
I hope to be able to discuss this matter in more detail at a later date.
In the interim, I will seek both spiritual advice and guidance".
On November 2, 2006, senior church officials told Colorado Springs television station KKTV that Haggard has admitted to some of the claims made by Jones.
In an e-mail to New Life Church parishioners sent on the evening of November 2, Acting Senior Pastor Ross Parsley wrote, "It is important for you to know that he [Haggard] confessed to the overseers that some of the accusations against him are true".
Haggard admitted on November 3, 2006 that he had purchased methamphetamine and received a massage from Jones, but he denied using the drugs or having sex with Jones.
"I called him to buy some meth, but I threw it away.
I bought it for myself but never used it", Haggard claimed in a television interview, and added, "I was tempted, but I never used it".
As it became apparent that some of the claims were true, some evangelical leaders such as Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell sought to downplay Haggard's influence on religious conservatives and downplay the importance of the NAE".
On his television show, The 700 Club, Robertson said, "We're sad to see any evangelical leader fall" and also said the claim that the NAE represents thirty million people "just isn't true.... We can't get their financial data.
I think it's because they have very little money and very little influence".
During a CNN interview, Jerry Falwell went on record saying, "[Haggard] doesn't really lead the movement.
He's president of an association that's very loose-knit... and no one has looked to them for leadership".
White House spokesman Tony Fratto sought to downplay Haggard's influence on the White House by saying that Haggard was only occasionally part of the weekly calls between evangelical leaders and the White House and had visited there only "a couple" of times.
James Dobson issued another public statement saying he was "heartsick" of learning about Haggard's admissions and that "the possibility that an illicit relationship has occurred is alarming to us and to millions of others".
He also stated that "[Haggard] will continue to be my friend, even if the worst allegations prove accurate" but "nevertheless, sexual sin, whether homosexual or heterosexual, has serious consequences".
Dobson initially offered to help counsel Haggard, but later announced a change of mind.
“It is with great regret - and after much prayer and discussion with friends and family - that I have had to reconsider my involvement in the panel overseeing Ted’s restoration,” Dobson said in a statement.
“Emotionally and spiritually, I wanted to be of help - but the reality is I don’t have the time to devote to such a critical responsibility.”
Admission and removal from job
On November 3, 2006, Haggard resigned his leadership of the National Association of Evangelicals.
The National Association of Evangelicals posted a statement accepting his resignation.
Leith Anderson was appointed as the new president on November 7 2006.
The "Overseer Board of New Life Church" released a prepared statement on the afternoon of November 4 2006 that stated: "Our investigation and Pastor Haggard's public statements have proven without a doubt that he has committed sexually immoral conduct".
The board cited the bylaws of the megachurch and said his conduct compelled them to remove him from his job.
During a New Life Church service on Sunday, November 5, 2006 another pastor read a letter from Haggard that stated:
Haggard went on to say that his removal was permanent, and that until a new senior pastor could be found, Ross Parsley, the Associate Senior Pastor, would hold that position.
Haggard was counseled by a team including Jack Hayford and Tommy Barnett who stated their intention to "perform a thorough analysis of Haggard’s mental, spiritual, emotional and physical life,” including the use of polygraph tests.
The team was to include James Dobson, who later stepped aside, citing time constraints.
In April 2007, Ted and Gayle Haggard moved to Phoenix, Arizona to start anew and continue the "restoration" process.
They will attend Phoenix First Assembly of God, whose pastor, Tommy Barnett, was on his counseling team.
Ted Haggard reached an agreement with New Life Church on a severance package which will pay him through 2007; one of the conditions was that he had to leave the Colorado Springs area.
His last reported income was $138,000 not including benefits.
Since the scandal broke, attendance at New Life Church has been down about 20 percent with financial support falling 10 percent.
As a consequence the church has laid off 44 employees representing about 12 percent of their workforce.
Claims of complete heterosexuality
In February 2007, Haggard sent an e-mail to friends, in which he stated his intention to move away from Colorado Springs to suburban New Orleans and, along with his wife, earn a degree in psychology.
According to a report published by Associated Press, Tim Ralph of the counseling team stated that evidence suggested that Haggard is "completely heterosexual" and that his only extramarital sexual contacts have been with former prostitute Mike Jones.
Ralph said, "It was the acting-out situations where things took place.
It wasn't a constant thing".
The claim has been satirized, most notably by Dan Savage in his Valentine's Day Savage Love column, and by the satirical singer-songwriter Roy Zimmerman, who wrote a song about the statement.
Jones responded to Ted Haggard's announcement:
Well, that's the quickest therapy I've ever heard of.
It's hard for me to imagine someone who is performing oral sex and saying that he is "straight".
That just doesn't jive.
If you were to ask me "Do I think is Ted Haggard gay?
" I would have to say "yes".
Jones explained that he could only speak to the time he spent with Haggard, that he had had an ongoing sexual relationship with the minister, and that their time together "indicated a gay man to me".
On February 6, 2008, the new pastor at New Life Church, former home to Ted Haggard, issued a press release announcing that Haggard had requested to leave the team created to "restore" him and that as Haggard's restoration is "incomplete", he is not welcome to return to vocational ministry at New Life.
Since leaving the church
In August 2007, Haggard released a statement asking for monetary donations to help support his family while he and his wife attend classes at the University of Phoenix, a university offering online degrees.
The former pastor also said that his family was moving into the Dream Center, a Phoenix based halfway house which ministers to recovering convicts, drug addicts, prostitutes etc.
Haggard is pursuing a degree in counseling while his wife Gayle is studying psychology.
Following Haggard's request for donations, a member of Haggard's restoration team said he should have consulted with them before releasing a statement.
News media pointed to his reported income: in 2006, he received $115,000 for the 10 months he worked and also received an $85,000 anniversary bonus shortly before the scandal broke; after the scandal broke, the board of trustees of New Life Church agreed to give him a $138,000 severance.
Additionally, the Haggards have a home in Colorado Springs, Colorado that is valued at more than $700,000 and Haggard still receives royalties from books he has authored.
Questions also surfaced about the tax-exempt group Haggard asked that donations be sent to, on his behalf: Families With a Mission.
According to Haggard, the group would use 10% of donations for administrative costs and forward 90% to Haggard.
But the group was dissolved in February 2007, according to the Colorado Secretary of State.
A few days after Haggard's initial email statement, his restoration team stepped in to say his statement was "inappropriate" and that "Haggard was a little ahead of himself".
They indicated that Haggard would not be working at the Dream Center or in ministry of any kind and that they advised Haggard to seek secular employment to support himself and his family.
In June 2008, the severance deal with the New Life Church at an end, Haggard was "free to live where he wanted" and returned to his Colorado Springs home after living in Westwego, Louisiana since 2007.
Also in June, an email surfaced in which Haggard admitted masturbating with Jones and taking drugs, as alleged in 2006.
Kurt Serpe, who provided the email, said Haggard "craved sex, he was a sexaholic".
In November 2008, Haggard said in guest sermons at an Illinois church that his actions had roots in sexual abuse by an adult when he was seven years old.
He also agreed to appear in an HBO  documentary about his sex scandal titled "The Trials of Ted Haggard", that premiered on HBO in January 2009.
According to the documentary, Haggard has begun a new career selling insurance.
As part of his media campaign to promote his documentary, Haggard told The Washington Post and many other media that he is “heterosexual with issues.”  Some in the gay community say Haggard is still processing his sexuality.
the Dallas Voice, a weekly LGBT newspaper wrote,“The really sad story is the truth, which Haggard has not faced... no amount of “ex-gay” therapy is about to change that.”
New homosexual sex allegations
On January 23, 2009, officials from Haggard's former church announced that a young male church member had come forward in 2006 and that there was an "overwhelming pool of evidence [of an] inappropriate, consensual sexual relationship [that] went on for a long period of time [with Haggard] ... it wasn't a one-time act".
Haggard's successor, Brady Boyd, said the church reached a six figure settlement with the man, who was in his early 20s at the time.
According to the man, he said the contact was "not consensual" and this is not about "opening new wounds" it's about a much larger issue.
The man, Brant Hass, added that New Life Church paid him $179,000 to cover his counseling to help recover from the situation, and pay college tuition.
Haggard admitted to the second relationship with Hass on CNN-TV and other media, and when asked if he had had additional gay relationships that have been unreported, Haggard would not provide a direct answer.
