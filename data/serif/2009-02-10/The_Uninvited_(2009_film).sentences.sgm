The Uninvited is a 2009 American remake of the 2003 South Korean horror film A Tale of Two Sisters.
It is unrelated to another 2003 Korean horror film and a 1944 American film of the same name.
Plot
The movie begins with a young girl, Anna (Emily Browning), making out with her boyfriend, Matt on the beach at a party.
After he tells her he loves her and he "has a condom", she gets up to leave.
As she goes, her sister Alex (Arielle Kebbel) asks if everything is all right.
On her way through the woods to her house, Anna encounters three white garbage bags.
When she goes to open them, the corpse of a redheaded girl falls out.
As Anna recoils, the girl's head snaps around and speaks.
Anna runs home.
Upon arriving, she hears the bell that her mother, who is terminally ill, rings when she needs something.
Anna is concerned because her mother is not supposed to be alone.
However, after she leaves the boathouse her mother is in, it explodes into flames.
All of a sudden a piece of debris comes flying towards her, burning her.
It is then revealed that this is a dream Anna is having.
She has been in a mental hospital since the death of her mother ten months earlier, but her psychiatrist believes she is ready to leave.
He tells her to "finish what she started".
As Anna packs, another patient comes in, asking Anna who she will tell her stories to now that Anna is leaving.
Anna's father (David Strathairn) takes her home, where she is joyfully reunited with her sister, Alex, who is angry that Anna never responded to the letters she wrote.
Once Anna tells her that she never received any letters, Alex yells at their father for not sending them.
He ignores her.
Anna also sees Rachel (Elizabeth Banks), her mother's former nurse who is now dating Anna's father.
Later that night, Anna overhears Rachel and her father having sex, so she turns up her music to a louder volume.
The next day, Anna meets with Matt, a friend.
Matt tells Anna he knows what happened the night of the fire.
However, Rachel comes before he can say anything more and sends him away.
That night, Anna wonders to herself if the fire that killed their mother was not an accident.
The next day, she and Rachel go into town so Anna can talk to Rachel.
Rachel discusses her former patients with Anna, telling her that the only way she got through it was by reminding herself that the people she was caring for would be dead soon.
She also showed Anna her pearls, saying they were a gift from one of her patients.
Anna sees the little girl from her dream along with two little boys, but in a moment they are gone.
When Anna meets up with Matt, he tells her he will meet her at "the rock" that night to tell her what he saw.
Anna and Alex wait on the rock, but he does not show up.
Later that night she goes home and goes upstairs to her bedroom, when Matt comes in her window, saying he hurt his back.
They speak for a few minutes and then begin to kiss, but when she runs her hand down his back, she touches a bone, which had snapped.
He grabs her arms as she recoils in horror.
The next day they find out that Matt snapped his back and had fallen into the water, where he drowned, on his way to see Anna.
Anna shows Alex that there are bruises on her arms where Matt grabbed her and Alex becomes scared for them both.
Later that night, Anna and Alex start research session and learn that Rachel lied about her name.
Anna confronts Rachel, who becomes angry and tells Anna if she says anything, she'll be sent back to the mental hospital.
That night, Rachel has a dinner party that Anna inadvertently ruins after the red-haired girl comes out from under the stove, telling Anna that "she's next".
The girls' father goes for a business trip on the day of Matt's funeral, and the redheaded girl shows Anna to the gravestones of a family of five.
Later that day, she researches the children of the family.
The suspected killer was a woman named Mildred Kemp, who was the nanny of the three children after their mother had died in a car accident a year before.
The killer had heavily sedated the children before stabbing them repeatedly.
In a picture, Anna sees the mother wearing a pearl necklace just like Rachel's.
The two sisters begin to think that Rachel and Mildred are one and the same.
Alex and Anna try to get to the pearls as evidence for a case against their father's girlfriend.
A struggle ensues between Anna and Rachel, but Anna manages to get the pearls.
When she goes upstairs to check if Alex is okay, she finds that Rachel has heavily drugged her with the needles Anna and Alex found earlier, and she must leave Alex behind.
Anna finds Rachel's car keys and tries to drive away, but the car stalls and Rachel catches up to her, only to be dragged to the ground once Anna manages to start the car again and drive off.
At the police station Anna explains everything, begging the police officer to hurry because Alex is still at the house.
He leaves, and while he is gone Anna falls asleep and dreams about her mother, but as she gets closer to her, the dream ends, replacing her mother with Rachel, who, with the police officer's help, sedates Anna and takes her back to the house where she suspects Rachel will kill her.
As Rachel prepares to dress Anna in her pajamas, Anna reaches for the knife on the dresser, but can't grasp it.
As the drugs are taking over, Anna sees Alex creeping up behind Rachel before she finally blacks out.
Once Anna wakes up once more, she sees a trail of blood that leads to the body of Rachel outside in a trashcan.
Alex steps out from the woods covered in blood, holding the knife and exclaiming that she had to do it.
They hug and clasp hands when their father pulls up into the driveway.
Anna and Alex begin explaining what happened.
Alex tells her dad that he never listens to her, but now he should.
Anna and Alex told their father what happened, and when Anna kept asking Alex to tell their father what she did to Rachel, her father grasps her and tells her that Alex is dead; she had died in the fire a year ago (which would explain why nobody paid attention or listened to what we knew as Alex earlier in the film).
Anna looks around for Alex, but realizes she is alone.
Suddenly, she notices Alex standing in the shadows.
As Anna slowly walks toward her, she sees that it's her reflection in a mirror, holding the bloody knife instead of Alex.
It is revealed that the night of the party, once Anna had come home, she had seen Rachel and her father having sex.
Disgusted, she went to the boathouse to fill a watering can with gasoline so she could burn down the house.
However, she did not shut off the faucet all the way, and when she slammed the door, Alex accidentally knocked over a lantern.
Once the gasoline reached the lantern the boathouse exploded, killing her mother and Alex.
Through a series of flashbacks, we see that Alex had never really been there, and that Anna had been the one who killed Matt and Rachel, and that Rachel was not truly evil.
Anna is arrested and institutionalized once again.
While Anna is back at the institution she says to her psychologist that she did what he had told her to, she had "finished what she started".
It is also revealed that the institutionalized woman at the beginning was "Mildred Kemp".
Production
Development
In 2002, producers Walter F. Parkes and Laurie MacDonald produced the hit horror thriller, The Ring, a groundbreaking remake of the Japanese film RING (Ringu, 1998) that signaled the start of a new trend in genre films – the thought-provoking thriller.
They would subsequently produce the film’s successful sequel The Ring Two in 2005.
Since first starting this new cycle of Asian horror film adaptations, Parkes and MacDonald searched for a project they felt was as ingeniously conceived and executed as The Ring,  and finally found it when producer Roy Lee brought the original Korean hit movie on which The Uninvited is based to their attention.
As A Tale of Two Sisters was playing in US theaters, directors Tom and Charlie Guard acquired the English language remake rights.
The Guard Brothers studied at Cambridge before launching careers as commercial and short film directors for such clients as Nokia, Euro Disney, PlayStation 2, and Xbox.
The Korean remake is their first feature film.In June 2006, DreamWorks announced that a deal had been set up for the US version, Tale of Two Sisters (advance press materials drop the “A” from the English title).
The new movie is a presentation of DreamWorks and Cold Spring Pictures (Disturbia), and is produced by Walter F. Parkes and Laurie MacDonald (The Ring, The Ring Two) and Roy Lee (nearly every Asian movie remake in recent memory).
The screenplay was written by Craig Rosenberg (After the Sunset, Lost), Doug Miro and Carlo Bernard (The Great Raid).
In the early of 2008, the title needed to be changed.
The working title was originally A Tale of Two Sisters like its predecessor, but the final title was confirmed to be The Uninvited in an announcement made in March.
The film was released to theaters on January 30, 2009.
Shooting location
The film was shot in Vancouver, British Columbia Canada.
Most of the film was shot at one location, a stunning waterfront property on British Columbia's Bowen Island, a short ferry ride west from mainland Vancouver".
' 'Eighty percent of the story take places at the house, so we couldn't make the movie without the right one,' said Walter F. Parkes.
It couldn't have been more important.
' 'We Scouted Louisiana, an environment which both beautiful and slightly threatening.
We had two houses which were terrible compromises, but both of them fell through.
We had a difficult time finding anything that had both the connection to the story and the right logistical possibilities.
'"
"'But then we were lucky to find in Canada a place that seemed as if it had been built for our movie'", he continues.
"'It was perfectly evocative and suggestive of a family that is both welcoming and forbidding.
The fact that the house was within 30 miles of Vancouver was a greater plus than the minus of having to get everyone on boats to get them over there; water taxis and ferries are a way of life up there.
In fact, I don’t remember ever having a more pleasant time on a location.
Getting onto a boat and having a cup of coffee and then going up the little pier and the stairs we built, it focused us.
We were isolated with one thing on our minds, which was making this movie.
It was great.
'"However, the film's location is also set in Steveston & Richmond, British Columbia, Canada as well.
It reported that a stunning two-story boathouse in the film was built on the property overlooking the water just for several scenes.
The cold water is rough and unappealing; it is a greenish-gray that crashes constantly and does not invite swimming.
Casting
Emily Browning, a 20-year-old Australian actress, was hired to portray the lead Anna Ivers.
She had originally auditioned for the role of Alex, however the producers thought she would make a good Anna so she was cast for this role.
The film is rated PG-13, and is going to be less visually gory and bloody than the original film.
Elizabeth Banks plays a new character personality as the wicked stepmother, Rachael, in the remake of the Korean horror flick.
Banks based her character Rachel on Rebecca De Mornay in The Hand that Rocks the Cradle".
It was very important to me that every line reading I gave could be interpreted two ways," says Banks of her role, "So that when you go back through the movie you can see that".
David Strathairn plays the concerned father of the two girls.
Arielle Kebbel plays Alex Ivers, the older sister of Anna.
The movie is 87 minutes long.
Music
The original score for the film was composed by Christopher Young, who recorded it with a 78-piece orchestra and 20-person choir.
