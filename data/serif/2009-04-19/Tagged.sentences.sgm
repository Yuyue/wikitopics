Tagged.com is a social networking site.
It was co-founded by Harvard graduates and entrepreneurs Greg Tseng and Johann Schleier-Smith.
Tagged.com was launched in October 2004 by Tagged Inc. and is privately owned.
Tagged Inc. has raised $7 million in funding, from Silicon Valley venture capital firm Mayfield Fund.
The site initially targeted US high school students but has since opened to all users worldwide age 13 and older.
The company reached profitability in early 2007.
The site allows its users to build and customize profiles, send messages, leave comments, post bulletins, customize status, browse photos, watch videos, play games, give gifts, give tags, chat and make friends.
Early innovations include the use of third-party widgets and YouTube as a part of the site’s graphical interface.
Other partnerships include Slide, RockYou, PhotoBucket, Meebo, Razz and Jangl.
As of July 2008, the site claims to have 70 million registered users.
In late 2008, Tagged raised $5 million venture debt from Horizon Technology Finance and Leader Ventures.
In December 2008, Social Networking Watch reported that Tagged.com ranked 4th, 9th, and 19th by Hitwise, Neilsen, and Comscore respectively.
Controversy
Tagged provides a feature whereby users are invited to provide it with their email username and password, and it will then check their email address books to see if their existing friends are already on Tagged.
They then have the option of connecting with friends already on Tagged and repeatedly sending email invites to friends who are not yet on Tagged.
This process has met some criticism in the technology press and from some users.
However, in March 2008 Microsoft announced a commercial partnership with social networking sites Tagged, Facebook, LinkedIn, Bebo, and hi5 regarding email contacts APIs.
Prior to Tagged, Greg Tseng was Co-Founder and CEO of Internet incubator Jumpstart Technologies.
In March 2006, Jumpstart Technologies settled with the FTC on alleged violations of the CAN-SPAM Act, which included a $900,000 fine, but no admission of guilt.
From February 2009, Tagged.com has been blocked in the State of Qatar by the only ISP Qtel after a number of "complaints from the public”.
Tagged.com is one of the 10 most visited sites in the State of Qatar.
