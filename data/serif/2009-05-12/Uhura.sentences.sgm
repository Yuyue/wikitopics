Nyota Uhura, originally played by Nichelle Nichols, is a character in Star Trek: The Original Series, Star Trek: The Animated Series, the first six Star Trek films, and the 2009 film Star Trek.
She is significant as one of the first major black characters on an American television series and for engaging in a then-taboo interracial kiss with James T. Kirk (William Shatner).
In the 2009 film Star Trek, a younger Uhura is portrayed by actress Zoë Saldana.
Development
Soon after the first scripts for Star Trek were being written, Gene Roddenberry spoke of a new character, a female communications officer and introduced Herb Solow and Robert Justman to Nichols, who had worked for him on The Lieutenant.
Solow and Justman approved of Nichols as an actress and as a means of having a racially diverse cast.
Name
Roddenberry had intended his new female communications officer to be called Lieutenant Sulu.
Solow pointed out how similar this was to "Zulu" and thought it might act against the plan for racial diversity in the show, so the name Sulu remained with George Takei's character.
"Uhura" comes from the Swahili word uhuru, which means "freedom".
Nichols states in her book Beyond Uhura that the name was inspired by her having had with her a copy of the book Black Uhuru on the day she read for the part.
When Justman explained to Roddenberry what the word "uhuru" meant, he changed it to Uhura and adopted that as the character's name.
Uhura's first name had never been definitively established in Star Trek canon until Abrams' 2009 film, in which it was officially indicated that her name is "Nyota".
Until that time, three names had been suggested as possible first names for Uhura: "(U)Penda", "Nyota" and "Samara".
In many appearances at Star Trek conventions, Nichols had indicated that the character is "Nyota (U)penda Uhura".
The non-canon book The Best of Trek suggests that Uhura's first name is "Penda", coined when a group of fanzine authors suggested it to her at an early convention.
When writing the licensed tie-in, Star Trek II Biographies for Pocket Books, author William Rotsler contacted Nichelle Nichols and sought her approval for using the name "Nyota", and this name started appearing in original Star Trek novels, such as Uhura's Song by Janet Kagan.
"Nyota" was also used as Uhura's first name when Nichols reprised the character in the fan film Star Trek: Of Gods and Men.
That "Nyota" is the Swahili word for "star" is mentioned by William Shatner in his book, Star Trek Memories.
Startrek.com uses the name Nyota on their character biography page for the Animated Series but not on the TOS biography page.
According to FASA's deprecated Star Trek RPG, Uhura's first name is "Samara".
Significantly, Nichols names a main character "Nyota" in her 1996 novel Saturn's Child, the mother of the titular character.
In the 2009 film, the mystery regarding Uhura's first name is the subject of a running joke as Kirk repeatedly tries to find out what it is, before finally hearing Spock utter it.
In Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country Uhura's name is misspelled in the credits.
It is spelled "Uhuru".
This misspelling has also appeared in numerous reference works and articles on the series.
Reception
Nichelle Nichols planned to leave Star Trek in 1967 after its first season, but Martin Luther King, Jr. persuaded her to stay, stating that she was a role model for the black community.
Whoopi Goldberg, who later played Guinan on Star Trek: The Next Generation, identified the Uhura character as a role model for her, recalling that she told her family, "I just saw a black woman on television; and she ain't no maid!
" NASA later employed Nichols in a campaign to encourage African Americans to join the service, and Dr. Mae Jemison, the first African-American woman to fly aboard the Space Shuttle, cited Star Trek as an influence in her decision to join.
In the 1968 episode "Plato's Stepchildren", Uhura is involved in an early TV portrayal of an interracial kiss.
This is frequently misremembered as "first televised portrayal of an interracial kiss on United States television" even though it took place after Sammy Davis, Jr. and Nancy Sinatra had openly kissed on the variety program Movin' With Nancy in December 1967.
Uhura's role on the show is spoofed with the character Tawny Madison/Gwen Di Marco, played by Sigourney Weaver, in Galaxy Quest.
Former  Leicester City manager Ian Holloway has also paid homage to the character, stating "I had a massive crush on her when I was little - I think we all did.
She was built to last!
"
Depiction
Uhura is from the United States of Africa and speaks Swahili.
James Blish's non-canon novels identify her as Bantu, as does Gene Roddenberry's novelization of Star Trek: The Motion Picture.
Uhura first appears in the episode "The Corbomite Maneuver", joining the crew of the USS Enterprise as a lieutenant, and serves as chief communications officer under Captain Kirk through both television series.
She is later promoted to lieutenant commander in Star Trek: The Motion Picture, and to full commander in Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan.
Star Trek III: The Search for Spock sees Uhura take an assignment in the transporter room as part of a plot to steal the Enterprise.
After locking a colleague in a closet, Uhura uses the transporter station to beam Kirk, Leonard McCoy and Hikaru Sulu to the Enterprise so they can use it to rescue Spock from the Genesis Planet.
As planned, Uhura later meets up with her crewmates on Vulcan and witnesses Spock's successful renewal.
Following these events and the destruction of the Enterprise, Uhura joins her crewmates on a stolen Klingon ship amid a crisis on Earth in Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home.
Traveling to the 20th century, they attempt to save a pair of humpback whales in order to repopulate the species.
During a trip to San Francisco, Uhura and Pavel Chekov infiltrate the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise and use emissions from the carrier's nuclear reactor to recharge the Klingon vessel's power supply.
Kirk and Spock then procure the whales so the crew can return to the 23rd century and save Earth.
In light of their heroics, Starfleet Command exonerates Uhura and the rest of Kirk's crew for their illegal activities.
Kirk is demoted to the rank of captain after a prior promotion to admiral, but is assigned to command the USS Enterprise-A.
Uhura joins Kirk's crew, and once again serves as chief communications officer throughout the events of Star Trek V: The Final Frontier and Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country.
In the 2009 film of the series, Zoë Saldana plays a young Uhura who is introduced as a cadet at the academy, but is promoted to a communication officer as the movie unfolds.
This Uhura is initially colder towards Kirk after he attempted to flirt with her, whilst intoxicated.
She is initially assigned to the Farragut in an attempt by Spock to avoid accusations of favouritism, but she demands he assign her to the Enterprise, and he agrees.
This movie also reveals that although a student of Spock's, Uhura is romantically involved with him, though it is unclear when this began.
