The following is a complete episode list for the television show Scrubs, which began being broadcast on October 2, 2001.
NBC had announced that Scrubs would end after its seventh season, containing a reduced 18 episodes.
However, a writer's strike ended up cutting the show's episodes down to 11, and Scrubs ended its run on NBC with a total of 150 episodes.
However, as of mid-April 2008, the cast returned to film an additional 19 episodes to be run as Season 8 by ABC.
In addition, a special called "My Charlie Brown Christmas" was created by Daniel Russ and Ryan Levin for the Scrubs 2003 Christmas party, it is a re-cut and re-dub of A Charlie Brown Christmas, starring the cast of Scrubs.
All episode titles begin with the word "My", unless the bulk of the episode is narrated by someone other than J.D., in which case they are named "His Story", "Her Story", or "Their Story", with Roman numerals denoting subsequent episodes by the same name.
As of May 6, 2009, 168 episodes of Scrubs have been broadcast.
The first seven seasons are available on DVD in Regions 1, 2 and 4.
Series overview
Season 1: 2001-2002
The first season follows J.D.
(Zach Braff) and his best friend Turk (Donald Faison) in their first year out of medical school as interns at Sacred Heart Hospital.
J.D.
quickly meets his reluctant mentor, Dr. Perry Cox (John C. McGinley); an attractive young woman (and fellow intern) named Elliot (Sarah Chalke), on whom he has a crush; the hospital's janitor (Neil Flynn), who goes out of his way to make J.D.
's life miserable; the Chief of Medicine, Dr. Bob Kelso (Ken Jenkins), who is more concerned about the budget than the patients; and Carla Espinosa (Judy Reyes), the head nurse and Turk's new girlfriend, who puts Turk through the trials and tribulations of being in a serious relationship.

Season 5: 2006
Though a full season of 24 episodes was produced for the fifth season, NBC decided against broadcasting them during the 2005–2006 fall schedule.
On December 1, 2005, NBC announced the return of Scrubs for mid-season.
At first, two new episodes were broadcast back-to-back every Tuesday at 9:00 p.m.
ET.
The first twelve episodes of the season were broadcast in this fashion, then NBC returned to broadcasting one new episode every week (still at 9:00 p.m.
ET), followed by a Scrubs rerun.
For the first three weeks of this, the old episode was a cast favorite episode, with available audio commentary tracks on NBC's website to accompany the episodes.
After this, with the premiere of Teachers in the 9:30 p.m. time slot, new Scrubs episodes continued to be broadcast at 9:00 p.m., with previous season five episodes being broadcast in the 8:30 p.m. time slot before.
Season 5 begins with J.D.
living in a hotel .
He has become an attending now on the same level as Dr. Cox.
Elliot has taken a new fellowship in another hospital.
Turk and Carla are trying to have a baby, despite Turk still having doubts.
Finally, some new interns have arrived to Sacred Heart, chief among them being Keith Dudemeister.
Season 6: 2006-2007
On May 15, 2006, NBC announced that Scrubs had been renewed for a full season (2006–2007), although it would be a mid-season replacement rather than appearing on NBC's autumn 2006 schedule (as was the case for the show's fifth season).
On October 25, NBC announced that, on November 30, Scrubs would move to Thursdays at 9:00pm, as part of two full hours of comedy (My Name Is Earl, The Office, Scrubs, and 30 Rock).
Over the course of the season, J.D.
and the other characters must mature to fill the different roles required of them.
J.D., for instance, is cast in the role of expecting father since his girlfriend, Dr. Kim Briggs, is pregnant with his child.
Turk and Carla become parents when Carla gives birth to their daughter, Isabella Turk.
Elliot plans her wedding to Keith, although she and J.D.
still harbor feelings for each other.
Dr. Cox, as father of two children with Jordan, struggles to prevent his foul disposition from affecting his parenting.
Important issues are touched upon, such as the importance of leadership, whether everything happens for a reason, and even death.
Season 7: 2007-2008
Scrubs returned for its seventh season on October 25, 2007, as part of NBC's Fall Schedule, broadcast on Thursdays with My Name Is Earl, The Office and 30 Rock.
According to Braff's blog, he and Bill Lawrence would direct a bulk of the episodes, and the show would see the return of many previous characters, including appearances by Aloma Wright, formerly nurse Laverne Roberts, as a new character, Nurse Shirley.
Also, Lawrence hinted that the Janitor's name would be revealed in the final episode; as of May 8, 2008 (the end of season 7), this has not occurred.
Season 7 was confirmed to have a reduced number of 18 episodes, but only 11 episodes were finished and 6 aired before the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike.
During the strike, several sources — including Braff's blog — announced that the series would end with the remaining 5 episodes already produced, starting on April 10, 2008, with the seventh episode My Bad Too, and that the last 6 planned episodes of the final season would not be produced.
Another episode, entitled "My Commitment" was partially completed before the WGA strike, but was never completed or aired.
Season 8: 2009
Needing to cut costs for the eighth season, Bill Lawrence stated that he divided the writing staff up into two groups, half for the first nine episodes and half for the second nine episodes; however, Garrett Donovan, Neil Goldman, and Bill Callahanwill stay for the whole season as Executive Producers and assistant head writers to Bill Lawrence (the head writer).
Additionally, each main cast member will not appear in three episodes this season.
An accompanying web series called "Scrubs: Interns" was also created to coincide with the season, starring the new interns with guest appearances by the main cast.
The webisodes can be viewed on ABC's website.
