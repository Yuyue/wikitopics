Adamantium is a fictional man-made metal alloy that has been depicted largely within the pages of comic books published by Marvel Comics.
Adamantium is frequently described as being virtually indestructible and the exact chemical composition is a United States government classified secret.
Adamantium is not an element: its properties do not qualify it for any known space on the Periodic Table of Elements.
Rather, Adamantium is a series of closely related compounds of iron created through a secret process discovered by the American metallurgist Dr. Myron MacLain.
Marvel Comics Adamantium
History and properties of adamantium in the Marvel Universe
Adamantium was first created by metallurgist Dr. Myron MacLain during the late 1960s in an attempt to recreate the unique Vibranium-steel alloy of Captain America's shield, though Adamantium contains no Vibranium.
While MacLain is unable to duplicate the process or discover the unknown element that created the alloy, he does create a material that is very similar on a molecular level and is almost as durable.
Adamantium is created by mixing several chemical resins together; the exact formula is a secret.
After the resins are mixed together, the adamantium can be molded into different shapes for approximately eight minutes as long as the mixture is kept at a temperature of 1,500 °F (816°C).
Adamantium's extremely stable molecular structure prevents it from being further molded after this eight-minute time period even if the temperature is high enough to keep it in its liquified form.
In its solid form, it is colorless, shiny, and resembles high-grade steel or titanium.
It is at least somewhat magnetic, since Magneto has manipulated it on multiple occasions.
Adamantium is astronomically expensive to create and the process is unreliable, often resulting in an inferior grade since the chemical resins mixed to create adamantium are a carefully guarded secret.
As a result, supervillains almost never try to create it but seek instead to harvest it from existing sources and rearrange it on a molecular level: Apocalypse has harvested adamantium from Sabretooth, and Genesis has harvested adamantium from Cyber.
Walter Simonson planned for Apocalypse to be the mastermind behind the Weapon X project that gave Wolverine his adamantium skeleton.
In Wolverine: Jungle Adventure (1990), Wolverine discovers an adamantium-laced skull in Apocalypse's laboratory, and comments how it seemed to have been there for eons.
Since Simonson' plans apparently never came to conclusion, the scene possibly suggests that Apocalypse developed the technology to bond adamantium to bones centuries before anyone else.
Types of adamantium
Secondary adamantium
As true adamantium is extremely difficult and expensive to create or manipulate, some parties found a way to duplicate it on a larger and more cost-effective scale at the expense of quality and durability.
For most practical purposes, this secondary adamantium is also largely indestructible.
Conventional weapons, such as ballistic missiles, have no effect on it; it is far stronger than even the most durable of titanium or steel compounds.
However, extraordinary blunt force, such as a punch from a being with superhuman strength, can warp or break it.
Unconventional forms of energy discharges have also been known to warp or damage secondary adamantium, such as Thor's lightning attacks using Mjolnir.
Writers created secondary adamantium to deal with supposedly indestructible adamantium having been damaged or destroyed in the past; all such instances were retconned as appearances of secondary adamantium.
Adamantium beta
Adamantium beta is a new metal created as a side-effect of the process of bonding true adamantium to  Wolverine's bones.
His Healing Factor not only allowed him to survive the process, but also induced a molecular change in the metal.
Adamantium beta functions identically to true adamantium, but it does not inhibit the biological processes of bone.
Adamantium beta was first explained in Wolverine (vol.2) #80 (1994).
Carbonadium
Carbonadium is a resilient, unstable metal that is vastly stronger than steel but more flexible than adamantium.
It is stated in X-Men vol.2 #7 that carbonadium is, in fact, both a more malleable and cheaper version of adamantium.
Due to its malleability, carbonadium is less durable than true adamantium, but still nearly indestructible.
Omega Red (an adversary of The X-Men) has carbonadium coils through which he can transmit his ability to drain life energies.
Carbonadium is highly radioactive and a very small amount, if  ingested, has proven capable of dramatically slowing down Wolverine's healing factor.
The only device that can produce carbonadium, known as the Carbonadium Synthesizer, was initially believed thrown into a river in Brussels by Wolverine; it has since been revealed that the Carbonadium Synthesizer had been hidden on the deceased body of a double-agent who died escaping Omega Red along with Wolverine, Sabretooth and Maverick.
The synthesizer was retrieved and handed back to Maverick, whose mission was to retrieve the item for parties unknown.
If implanted within the body, objects composed of Carbonadium have proven to slow the accelerated healing factors of Wolverine and his son Daken.
While slowed considerably, their healing powers aren't completely supressed.
It is currently unknown if Carbonadium affects other beings with superhuman healing powers in a similar manner.
Allotropes
In X-Men #191, when confronting Wolverine, one of the Children of the Vault named Serafina claims that adamantium has thirteen allotropes, all of which are "unstable, and short-lived, but virulently poisonous".
She throws a small device that clamps onto his claws and makes them glow green, claiming that it is adamantium nine.
This causes Wolverine to become stricken, incoherent and collapse.
Adamantium as key component
Adamantium is used as the key component in several instances in the Marvel Universe, including:
Agent Zero's combat knife
The outer skin of some of Alkhema's robotic bodies
Battlestar's shield
Bullseye's spinal column and some strips coating several of his bones.
Constrictor's original wrist-mounted, prehensile metal coils
Cyber's claws and skin
A unique set of Doctor Octopus' arms
The outer layer of Citizen V's rapier
Lady Deathstrike's skeleton and talons
One of Mister Fantastic's labs for extremely dangerous experiments
Moon Knight's crescent blades
A unique suit of armor once used by the villain Stilt-Man
The outer skin of TESS-One
The outer skin of some of Ultron's robotic bodies
Wolverine's skeleton and claws
X-23's claws
One of several layers of containment at the superhuman incarceration facility known as the Vault
An outer coating on the Swordsman's blades.
A special brand of bullet in the Iron Man suit's ballistic weapons.
Underworld uses adamantium bullets
Durability of adamantium
While often referred to as indestructible or unbreakable, it is possible for it to be destroyed through very specific circumstances.
True adamantium can be destroyed through very precise molecular rearrangement, such as being altered by Thanos while wearing the Infinity Gauntlet.
True adamantium's molecular structure can also be altered by Antarctic vibranium, also known as anti-metal, as it has the capability to liquify all known metallic substances, including adamantium.
There are at least two known examples of true adamantium within the Earth-616 reality sustaining damage without molecular manipulation.
The first involves the Norse god Thor focusing all of his strength into striking a small cylinder of adamantium with Mjolnir, which is only slightly dented.
The second incident involves a battle between Ultron and the Incredible Hulk.
During the fight, the Hulk punches the robot with enough force to slightly dent it.
Within the Earth-1610 reality, otherwise known as the Ultimate Marvel Universe, adamantium also exists but there is evidence that brings into question the status of adamantium as "unbreakable" or "indestructible" in comparison with the Earth-616 version.
There is an example of the Ultimate Marvel version of Wolverine being ripped in half by the Ultimate Marvel version of the Hulk.
Within the same issue, a question was raised by another character as to whether Wolverine's joints were bonded with adamantium.
As to whether the connective tissues between Wolverine's joints are torn, the adamantium was damaged, or both is not fully known as the Ultimate Wolverine vs. Hulk mini-series has met with numerous delays.
There is also an instance of the Hulk breaking a needle made of adamantium.
During the initial appearances of the Ultimate Marvel Universe's version of Sabretooth, it is revealed that he has four retractable adamantium claws implanted within each of his forearms.
Through circumstances that have yet to be explained, one of the claws implanted within Sabretooth's left forearm is broken.
There is also at least one known incident of adamantium within the Earth-1610 reality being damaged by conventional weaponry.
In a memory flashback, the Ultimate Marvel version of Nick Fury recalls an adamantium cage containing Wolverine is shelled and destroyed during Operation: Desert Storm.
The Ultimate Marvel version Lady Deathstrike also has an adamantium-laced skeleton, and claimed to be indestructible on one occasion.
Nonetheless, when she is grabbed in a stranglehold by Longshot, he manages to snap her neck.
More recently is an incident involving Apocalypse and Wolverine.
As the two battle, Apocalypse rips Wolverine's right arm completely off, though it is later reconnected as Phoenix alters reality.
These facts have sparked heated debate and controversy among comic book fans and Marvel Comics has not provided an explanation for the noticeable difference in the durability of the two versions.
Properties of adamantium in the Ultimate Marvel Universe
Little is known about the UMU version of adamantium.
Among the most notable information yet to be revealed includes when adamantium is first created, the person or persons responsible for first creating it, and any of the properties and processes used in creating it.
Only one form of adamantium has been seen in the Ultimate Universe thus far.
It is currently unknown whether or not any other versions of adamantium exist, as they do in the Earth-616 reality.
Adamantium in the UMU is highly durable and is able to effectively protect a person's mind from telepathic probing or attacks, a property that the Earth-616 version lacks completely.
It has been shown as a component of the claws and skeleton of the Ultimate Wolverine and Ultimate Lady Deathstrike.
The UMU's version of Sabretooth's natural claws are bonded with adamantium and he possesses four retractable claws similar to those of Wolverine implanted in his forearms.
The shield of Ultimate Captain America is entirely comprised of adamantium.
In other media
The name Adamantium has been used by other writers, game designers and publishing companies to describe similar substances, possibly inspired by the use by Marvel.
Games
In the Warhammer 40,000 universe, adamantium is a super-hard alloy used by the Imperium of Man in the construction of weapons and armour.
Notably, the Black Dragons Space Marines Chapter sheathes mutated bone growths in adamantium to use them as close combat weapons.
Also, Tactical Dreadnought Armor is said to be made from plates of Adamantium in addition to other forms of protection, to make it all but impenetrable.
It is also found in Blizzard's World of Warcraft as the Ornate Adamantium Breastplate.
There was a mineable variation of Adamantium known as Adamantite added in the Burning Crusade expansion pack.
Adamantium armor and weapons can be found in Bethesda Softworks' The Elder Scrolls Series, first in the Tribunal expansion to The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind, then in a mod for The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion.
Adamantium armor is a form of armor in the PlayStation 2 game Ratchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenal.
In Two Worlds there are two available Earth Magic spells with adamantium references.
These spells are Summon Adamantium Golem (the strongest summon in the game), and Adamantium Shield.
In the MMORPG Runescape, it is possible to mine Adamantite Ore and smith it into Adamant weaponry and armour.
The Adamantite armor and weapons are fairly weak when compared with most other armour avaliable.
There was a time when Adamantite was the strongest metal, being better than Mithril, another fictional substance of extreme durability.
In Dungeons & Dragons v3.5, adamantine is described as "an ultra hard metal found only in meteorites and the rares veins in magical areas", weighs the same as steel, and can cut through any lesser material with ease.

In the fantasy game Dwarf Fortress, a substance known as Adamantine is so rare, that striking it will trigger the coming of The Dwarf King.
Its melting point is so high that it is immune to destruction by lava, and is much stronger than any other material for constructing armor or weapons.
It is also much lighter and is rather brittle because it has no elasticity.
World of Warcraft has, like in Dwarf Fortress, Adamantine.
The adamantite ore is smelted into adamantite bars, which are then used by blacksmiths to create adamantite armor sets.
Adamantite weapons consist of the following classes: maces, swords, daggers, axes, arrows, guns, and, bullets.
The raw material "adamantite" exists in several Final Fantasy games.
In Lost Odyssey, there is a sword called Adamantis, forged from Adamantium.
Films
As with his comics counterpart, the X-Men film series version of Wolverine also possesses adamantium in his skeleton and claws.
In X2: X-Men United, liquid adamantium was seen boiling in a tub.
(William Stryker mentioned that the "tricky thing with adamantium is, you gotta keep it hot".
) The X2 version of Deathstrike is also shown to have adamantium claws that are extruded from the tips of her fingers (Wolverine's are sheathed in his forearms and released between his knuckles).
In X-Men Origins: Wolverine, adamantium is discovered in the form of a meteorite that fell to Earth somewhere in Nigeria.
However, the film doesn't reveal much about the meteorite itself.
It isn't known if adamantium is a material created by William Stryker's team of scientists based on studying the meteorite or if it is an accurate reproduction of the material itself.
Whatever the case, adamantium is eventually cultivated for use as weaponry.
Aside from bonding the metal to Wolverine's skeleton, the film also depicts several bullets composed of adamantium.
Another deviation from the comic book is the film depicts that it is possible for adamantium to be pierced by adamantium, as shown when Stryker shoots Wolverine twice in the head at point blank range.
In the Marvel Comics animated feature Ultimate Avengers, Captain America's shield is composed of an adamantium/vibranium alloy.
In the 1998 film Lost in Space, the spider-like organisms are described as having an "Adamantium shell".
The organisms were destroyed by exposure to a nuclear fusion explosion.
